bust</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Large language models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT and Claude.ai are whizzy and cool.\nA lot of people think that they are going to be The Future.  Maybe they are —\nbut that doesn't mean that building them is going to be a profitable business.</p>\n<!-- This is the tricky bit about technologies.  Just because your technology gets -->\n\n<!-- adopted, it does not follow that you make much money.  Web browsers have -->\n\n<!-- nearer 100% adoption than probably any piece of software around.  They are also -->\n\n<!-- genuinely hard to make.  So they must be pretty profitable, right?  No - they -->\n\n<!-- are a huge money loser.  The web browser business is so bad that few would even -->\n\n<!-- count it as a business at all. -->\n\n<p>In the 1960s, airlines were The Future.  That is why old films have so many\nswish shots of airports in them.  Airlines though, turned out to be an\nunavoidably rubbish business.  I've flown on loads of airlines that have gone\nbust: Monarch, WOW Air, Thomas Cook, Flybmi, Zoom.  And those are all busts\nfrom before coronavirus - times change but being an airline is always a bad\nidea.</p>\n<p>That's odd, because other businesses, even ones which seem really stupid, are\nmuch more profitable.  Selling fizzy drinks is, surprisingly, an amazing\nbusiness.  Perhaps the best.  Coca-Cola's return on equity has rarely fallen\nbelow 30% in any given year.  That seems very unfair because being an airline\nis hard work but making coke is pretty easy.  It's even more galling because\nCoca-Cola don't actually make the coke themselves - that is outsourced to\n\"bottling companies\".  They literally just sell it.</p>\n<h2>Industry structure - what makes a business good</h2>\n<p>If you were to believe LinkedIn you would think a great business is made with\nefficiency, hard work, innovation or some other intrinsic reason to do with how\nhardworking, or clever, the people in the business are.  That simply is not the\ncase.</p>\n<p>What makes a good business is industry structure.</p>\n<h3>Airlines - unfavourable industry structure</h3>\n<p>To be an airline is to be in an almost uniquely terrible market position.\nFor starters, there are only two makers of aeroplanes (Airbus and Boeing).  For\nreasons of training and staff efficiency, you have to commit to one or the\nother, which gives the aeroplane makers very strong pricing power.</p>\n<p>And buyers of airline tickets are incredibly fickle and have no loyalty.  They will\nswitch from one \"carrier\" to another over even small differences in price.\nAnnoyingly, there are loads of other airlines and they're all running the same\nroutes as you!</p>\n<p>Worse yet, starting a new airline is surprisingly easy.  Aircraft hold their\nvalue so banks will happily lend against them.  There are loads of staff\navailable that new entrants can hire.  So randos will continually enter your\nmarket, often selling tickets below cost for quite a while before they go bust.\nAnd to top it off, there are plenty of substitutes for air travel - from\ngovernment-subsidised high speed trains to Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Airlines that get more efficient, work harder or come up with innovations\naren't going to be able to \"capture\" the value of what they've done.  If you\nmake more than the bare minimum to survive Airbus will notice that you're being\nundercharged and you'll find that the next renewal on your service contract\neats up the difference.</p>\n<h3>Fizzy-drinks - very favourable industry structure</h3>\n<p>Being the Coca-Cola company is pretty great though.</p>\n<p>Coke is just water, colourant, flavouring, caffeine and sweetener.  Those are\nall widely available and really cheap.  And as I said, you don't even have to\ncombine them yourselves - bottling companies will do that for you for almost\nnothing.</p>\n<p>Handily, consumers are really picky about what goes in their mouth.  The\nunofficial motto of your main competitor is \"Is Pepsi ok?\".  This is despite\nthe fact that they are identical in both taste and colour.  And a significant\nminority of people actually say no!</p>\n<p>And it isn't easy for new competitors to enter the market.  They can't call\ntheir new drink \"coke\" due to trademarks.  They have to call it something else.\nAnd consumers will generally refuse it because drinking an alternative is\nconsidered some kind of weird statement.</p>\n<h2>What is industry structure?</h2>\n<p>Classically, there are five basic parts (\"forces\") to a company's position:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The power of their <strong>suppliers</strong> to increase their prices</li>\n<li>The power of their <strong>buyers</strong> to reduce your prices</li>\n<li>The strength of <strong>direct competitors</strong></li>\n<li>The threat of any <strong>new entrants</strong></li>\n<li>The threat of <strong>substitutes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's industry structure that makes a business profitable or not.  Not\nefficiency, not hard work and not innovation.</p>\n<p>If none of the forces are very much against you, your business will do ok.  If\nthey are all against you, you'll be in the position of the airlines.  And if\nthey're all in your favour: brill, you're Coca-Cola.</p>\n<h2>The industry structure of LLM makers: OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/etc</h2>\n<p>So is the position of LLM makers any good?  I'm afraid it's not good news.</p>\n<p>LLM makers sometimes imply that their suppliers are cloud companies like Amazon\nWeb Services, Google Cloud, etc.  That wouldn't be so bad because you could\nshop around and make them compete to cut the huge cost of model training.</p>\n<p>Really though, LLM makers have only one true supplier: NVIDIA.  NVIDIA make the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)\">chips</a> that all\nmodels are trained on - regardless of cloud vendor.  And that gives NVIDIA\ncolossal, near total pricing power.  NVIDIA are more powerful relative to\nAnthropic or OpenAI than Airbus or Boeing could ever dream of being.</p>\n<p>How much power do buyers have over LLM token prices?  So far, it seems fairly\nhigh.  Most LLM users seem willing to change from Chat-GPT to Claude, for\nexample.  It doesn't seem like brand loyalty is being built up.  And companies\nthat build AI into their businesses are starting to do so via abstraction\nlayers that allow them to switch model easily.  That makes LLMs\ninterchangeable - which is bad for those who sell them.</p>\n<p>What's the strength of direct competitors?  Again, it is considerable.  There\nare loads of LLM vendors and pricing <a href=\"https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/\">appears\ncompetitive</a>.  Worst of all,\nFacebook basically dump their model on the market for no cost.  It's\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war_(1995%E2%80%932001)\">reminiscent of Internet\nExplorer</a> -\nnot exactly a great portent.</p>\n<p>And it seems fairly easy for new entrants to build brand new models.  That is\nwhy there are so many LLM makers.  Most of the techniques for making LLMs are\nopenly published in papers.  Even bad models can gain customers if they are\ncheap, which allows new entrants to gain a foothold.</p>\n<p>The situation on substitutes is mixed.  Instead of having Chat-GPT write some\ntext you could pay a person to do it instead.  That is likely to be much more\nexpensive but also less likely to hallucinate, which might be important for\nsome use-cases (law is the field least likely to use LLMs).  And then there is\nthe trend that <a href=\"/metadata.html\">metadata tends to displace artificial\nintelligence</a> once particular application has been proved out -\nso as soon as you find a solid use-case you stand to be replaced.</p>\n<p>A single mildly positive point does not make a profitable business.  LLM makers\nlook a lot more like Netscape - who invented graphical web browsers, then went\nbust - than Google, who made something good that ran on top of the web\nbrowsers.</p>\n<h2>How are they raising so much money?</h2>\n<p>If LLM makers seem cursed to an airline-style business destiny, how come they\nare able to raise so much money?  OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/\">raised $6.6\nbillion</a>\nat a valuation of $157 billion less than two months ago.  That might be the\nbiggest VC round of all time.</p>\n<p>What do they know that I don't?  It is a mystery - but let's consider the\noptions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps they are hoping to develop their own chips to reduce their dependence\non NVIDIA.  $6.6 billion is not enough to build a new fab but it might be\nenough to get a new chip designed which allows them to migrate off NVIDIA.\nThat would save them paying so much money for GPU time.  But, NVIDIA are\nactually one of the investors in the round (although only a fairly small\namount) - so it's unlikely \"develop an NVIDIA competitor\" was on any of the\npitch deck slides.</p>\n<p>Perhaps OpenAI are hoping to build a strong brand so that customers won't\nswitch to competitors so easily.  It's not impossible, there is proof the\n<a href=\"/amazon-premium.html\">branding</a> and lock-in can work in technology - but it\nseems difficult to manage given that LLMs themselves generically have a textual\ninterface - meaning that there is no real API as such - you just send text, and\nit sends text back.</p>\n<p>Can they do anything about new entrants?  Possibly.  If investing $6.6bn allows\nthem to develop a major improvement in their model then that would raise\neveryone else's costs considerably and probably force some of their smaller\ncompetitors out of the market.  The trouble is that money is the most fungible\nof all goods (that is the point, after all) and that $6.6bn is not all that\nmuch of it.  So this round wouldn't, by itself, be enough to dissuade others.\nI used to work at a bank and I can tell you that individual bond raises can be\na lot more than $6.6bn.</p>\n<p>It's worth saying that even companies that raise huge sums of money sometimes\nturn out to have no viable business.  WeWork ultimately raised over $10bn at a\nvaluation of $47bn before it was realised that their business simply did not\nmake sense.  WeWork were valued at just $0.56bn in their most recent financial\nrestructuring - having lost well over 95% of what was invested.</p>\n<h2>Not all AI companies are doomed</h2>\n<p>If LLM makers aren't going to be good businesses, does that bode ill for The\nFuture?</p>\n<p>Firstly, it does not mean the technology will be bad.  Whether the technology\nends up being good or not is mostly unrelated to whether Open\nAI/Anthropic/Mistral/whoever makes any money off it.  Container virtualisation\ntechnology is pretty well developed even though Docker made almost nothing on\nit.  Web browsers are extremely advanced pieces of software even though making\na browser is such a bad business that most don't usually count it as a business\nat all.  And CRMs are terrible despite the fact that Salesforce is tremendously\nsuccessful.  Technology success and business success are mostly unrelated.</p>\n<p>And then: not all AI businesses are building models.  Ideally, if I were\nrunning an AI business I would avoid building a model at all costs.  Building\nyour own models looks like an undifferentiated schlep.  Using a tiny bit of some\nexpensively trained model that Anthropic has produced could be very cost\neffective and might make some business idea work that wouldn't have 5 years\nago.</p>\n<h2>Beware software companies that aren't software companies</h2>\n<p>Software companies are really good businesses.

That simply is not the\ncase.</p>\n<p>What makes a good business is industry structure.</p>\n<h3>Airlines - unfavourable industry structure</h3>\n<p>To be an airline is to be in an almost uniquely terrible market position.\nFor starters, there are only two makers of aeroplanes (Airbus and Boeing).  For\nreasons of training and staff efficiency, you have to commit to one or the\nother, which gives the aeroplane makers very strong pricing power.</p>\n<p>And buyers of airline tickets are incredibly fickle and have no loyalty.

Aircraft hold their\nvalue so banks will happily lend against them.  There are loads of staff\navailable that new entrants can hire.  So randos will continually enter your\nmarket, often selling tickets below cost for quite a while before they go bust.\nAnd to top it off, there are plenty of substitutes for air travel - from\ngovernment-subsidised high speed trains to Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Airlines that get more efficient, work harder or come up with innovations\naren't going to be able to \"capture\" the value of what they've done.

Those are\nall widely available and really cheap.  And as I said, you don't even have to\ncombine them yourselves - bottling companies will do that for you for almost\nnothing.</p>\n<p>Handily, consumers are really picky about what goes in their mouth.

Not\nefficiency, not hard work and not innovation.</p>\n<p>If none of the forces are very much against you, your business will do ok.  If\nthey are all against you, you'll be in the position of the airlines.  And if\nthey're all in your favour: brill, you're Coca-Cola.</p>\n<h2>The industry structure of LLM makers: OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/etc</h2>\n<p>So is the position of LLM makers any good?  I'm afraid it's not good news.</p>\n<p>LLM makers sometimes imply that their suppliers are cloud companies like Amazon\nWeb Services, Google Cloud, etc.  That wouldn't be so bad because you could\nshop around and make them compete to cut the huge cost of model training.</p>\n<p>Really though, LLM makers have only one true supplier: NVIDIA.  NVIDIA make the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)\">chips</a> that all\nmodels are trained on - regardless of cloud vendor.  And that gives NVIDIA\ncolossal, near total pricing power.  NVIDIA are more powerful relative to\nAnthropic or OpenAI than Airbus or Boeing could ever dream of being.</p>\n<p>How much power do buyers have over LLM token prices?  So far, it seems fairly\nhigh.  Most LLM users seem willing to change from Chat-GPT to Claude, for\nexample.  It doesn't seem like brand loyalty is being built up.  And companies\nthat build AI into their businesses are starting to do so via abstraction\nlayers that allow them to switch model easily.  That makes LLMs\ninterchangeable - which is bad for those who sell them.</p>\n<p>What's the strength of direct competitors?  Again, it is considerable.  There\nare loads of LLM vendors and pricing <a href=\"https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/\">appears\ncompetitive</a>.  Worst of all,\nFacebook basically dump their model on the market for no cost.  It's\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war_(1995%E2%80%932001)\">reminiscent of Internet\nExplorer</a> -\nnot exactly a great portent.</p>\n<p>And it seems fairly easy for new entrants to build brand new models.  That is\nwhy there are so many LLM makers.  Most of the techniques for making LLMs are\nopenly published in papers.  Even bad models can gain customers if they are\ncheap, which allows new entrants to gain a foothold.</p>\n<p>The situation on substitutes is mixed.  Instead of having Chat-GPT write some\ntext you could pay a person to do it instead.  That is likely to be much more\nexpensive but also less likely to hallucinate, which might be important for\nsome use-cases (law is the field least likely to use LLMs).  And then there is\nthe trend that <a href=\"/metadata.html\">metadata tends to displace artificial\nintelligence</a> once particular application has been proved out -\nso as soon as you find a solid use-case you stand to be replaced.</p>\n<p>A single mildly positive point does not make a profitable business.  LLM makers\nlook a lot more like Netscape - who invented graphical web browsers, then went\nbust - than Google, who made something good that ran on top of the web\nbrowsers.</p>\n<h2>How are they raising so much money?</h2>\n<p>If LLM makers seem cursed to an airline-style business destiny, how come they\nare able to raise so much money?  OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/\">raised $6.6\nbillion</a>\nat a valuation of $157 billion less than two months ago.  That might be the\nbiggest VC round of all time.</p>\n<p>What do they know that I don't?  It is a mystery - but let's consider the\noptions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps they are hoping to develop their own chips to reduce their dependence\non NVIDIA.  $6.6 billion is not enough to build a new fab but it might be\nenough to get a new chip designed which allows them to migrate off NVIDIA.\nThat would save them paying so much money for GPU time.  But, NVIDIA are\nactually one of the investors in the round (although only a fairly small\namount) - so it's unlikely \"develop an NVIDIA competitor\" was on any of the\npitch deck slides.</p>\n<p>Perhaps OpenAI are hoping to build a strong brand so that customers won't\nswitch to competitors so easily.  It's not impossible, there is proof the\n<a href=\"/amazon-premium.html\">branding</a> and lock-in can work in technology - but it\nseems difficult to manage given that LLMs themselves generically have a textual\ninterface - meaning that there is no real API as such - you just send text, and\nit sends text back.</p>\n<p>Can they do anything about new entrants?  Possibly.  If investing $6.6bn allows\nthem to develop a major improvement in their model then that would raise\neveryone else's costs considerably and probably force some of their smaller\ncompetitors out of the market.  The trouble is that money is the most fungible\nof all goods (that is the point, after all) and that $6.6bn is not all that\nmuch of it.  So this round wouldn't, by itself, be enough to dissuade others.\nI used to work at a bank and I can tell you that individual bond raises can be\na lot more than $6.6bn.</p>\n<p>It's worth saying that even companies that raise huge sums of money sometimes\nturn out to have no viable business.  WeWork ultimately raised over $10bn at a\nvaluation of $47bn before it was realised that their business simply did not\nmake sense.  WeWork were valued at just $0.56bn in their most recent financial\nrestructuring - having lost well over 95% of what was invested.</p>\n<h2>Not all AI companies are doomed</h2>\n<p>If LLM makers aren't going to be good businesses, does that bode ill for The\nFuture?</p>\n<p>Firstly, it does not mean the technology will be bad.  Whether the technology\nends up being good or not is mostly unrelated to whether Open\nAI/Anthropic/Mistral/whoever makes any money off it.  Container virtualisation\ntechnology is pretty well developed even though Docker made almost nothing on\nit.  Web browsers are extremely advanced pieces of software even though making\na browser is such a bad business that most don't usually count it as a business\nat all.  And CRMs are terrible despite the fact that Salesforce is tremendously\nsuccessful.  Technology success and business success are mostly unrelated.</p>\n<p>And then: not all AI businesses are building models.  Ideally, if I were\nrunning an AI business I would avoid building a model at all costs.  Building\nyour own models looks like an undifferentiated schlep.  Using a tiny bit of some\nexpensively trained model that Anthropic has produced could be very cost\neffective and might make some business idea work that wouldn't have 5 years\nago.</p>\n<h2>Beware software companies that aren't software companies</h2>\n<p>Software companies are really good businesses.  You have no real suppliers,\nyour software is often unique (so no competitors) and the substitute is just\nusers doing the job themselves.  For this reason, software companies tend have\nreally great margins.</p>\n<p>The problem is that not all technology companies are software companies.
