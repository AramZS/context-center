The Immunization  Monitoring Program ACTive (IMPACT) is a pediatric, hospital-based network  administered by the Canadian Paediatric Society.

Like adults, children and youth are well protected against severe illness 14 days after their second dose.

Reactions are most often mild and go away by themselves within hours or days. The COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are no longer in the body after a few days. Only the immune response to protect against COVID-19 remains.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Common vaccine side effects may include:\n  \n  \n    \n      Symptoms at the injection site, such as:\n      More general symptoms, such as:\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        redness\n        soreness\n        swelling\n      \n      \n        chills\n        fatigue\n        joint pain\n        headache\n        mild fever\n        muscle aches\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    Myocarditis and pericarditis\n  \n\n\n  Myocarditis is the inflammation  of the heart muscle, while pericarditis refers to inflammation of the lining  that surrounds the outside of the heart. \n  \n  Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with mRNA  COVID-19 vaccines have been reported.

For instance, for the primary series the:\n\n\n  Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty  vaccine was tested in children 5 to 11 years of age\n  Moderna  Spikevax vaccine was tested in children 6 to 11 years of age\n  Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and  Moderna Spikevax vaccines were tested in youth 12 to 17 years of age \n\n\nIn these studies:\n\n  no safety issues were detected\n  the vaccines were shown to provide very good protection against COVID-19 in the 2 months after vaccination\n\n\nHealth  Canada continues to monitor reactions reported following vaccination. Millions  of children have safely received the pediatric Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty  vaccine in Canada and around the world.

Canada’s  vaccine safety monitoring system also helps to detect any possible rare side effects that  didn’t appear in the clinical trials.\n\nCanada also has a safety surveillance  system in place that’s  specifically designed for monitoring pediatric vaccinations. The Immunization  Monitoring Program ACTive (IMPACT) is a pediatric, hospital-based network  administered by the Canadian Paediatric Society.
