If I publish something on this blog, the presumption is that I retain rights unless I specifically license them â€“ for example, by attaching a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">creative commons</a> license. If I donâ€™t do that, you canâ€™t legally reuse my content (unless your use falls within certain exemptions).</p>\n\n<p>You can think about this arrangement in terms of protocol design: itâ€™s an agreement between parties whose nature creates certain incentives and barriers to behaviour. Someone who wants to reuse my content has the burden of getting a license from me, and proving that they have one if I challenge them. I have the burden of finding misuse of my content and pursuing it.</p>\n\n<p>Technical systems can assist both parties in these tasks. I can use search engines of various sorts to find potential abuses; a licensee can prove that a particular license was available by showing its existence in the cache of a disinterested third party (often, one of the same search engines).</p>\n\n<p>This creates an equilibrium: the burdens are balanced to favour certain behaviours. You might argue that the balance is unjust (and many <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net\">do</a>), but it is known and stable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"hero\">As <a href=\"https://www.mnot.net/blog/2024/04/21/ai-control\">discussed previously</a>, the EU AI Act and emerging practice flip copyrightâ€™s default opt-in regime to an opt-out one.
