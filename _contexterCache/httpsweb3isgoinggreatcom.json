[and] we are required to cancel your current loans\". The email stated that if a borrower was unable to repay their loans by March 15, seven days from the date the email was sent, \"outstanding loans and the associated interest will be automatically repaid\". This seems like a tough timeline for borrowers, whose loans are twelve months long, and given people tend to spend the cash they've borrowed on something, rather than, say, hold on to it in case they need to suddenly repay a loan with a week's notice.<p>Reddit users from the UK, Germany, France, and Switzerland reported receiving the email, and those countries now all appear on the <a href=\"https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/4771679-what-qualification-does-the-user-need-to-meet-to-use-crypto-com-lending\" target=\"_blank\">40-entry-long list</a> of countries not permitted to use Crypto.com's lending services. One Reddit user wrote, \"I have 7 days to pay a big loan, like big. If it gave us a month I could unstake and pay, but no, they give us 7 [days], I will get liquified and can’t do anything for it.\" Other users were confused to receive the email when they didn't have any loans on the platform, as it was worded in a way that they interpreted to mean they did.</p></span></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/08/cryptocom-tells-loan-customers-in-excluded-countries-to-repay-by-march-15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>\"Crypto.com Tells Loan Customers in 'Excluded' Countries to Repay by March 15\"</span></a><span>, <i>CoinDesk</i></span></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/1501213198774681601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Tweet thread by Bitfinexed</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/comments/t9md4t/just_a_week_after_the_earn_debacle_cryptocom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>\"Just a week after the ‘Earn’ debacle, Crypto.com fucks up again by announcing that anyone with a Crypto Loan needs to repay it within 7 days – or be forcibly liquidated via funds in their Spot Wallet.

All told, the project earned almost 21&nbsp;ETH ($55,000). danvee.eth wrote on Twitter that he would try to refund people who wished to be refunded (so long as they were nice to him); as of that day no refunds had been sent from addresses associated with the project.</span></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/danveeeth/status/1500516457947582474\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Tweet by danvee.eth</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/battlecatsarena\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>BattleCats Arena OG</span></a><span> on OpenSea</span></li><li><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe05a1d191335c57523578d805551226f82b2c0b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Contract address</span></a><span> on Etherscan</span></li></ul></div><div class=\"entry-footer\"><div><div class=\"tags\"><div class=\"tag-list theme\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Theme tags: </span><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>Rug pull</div><div class=\"tag-group-right\"><div class=\"tag-list\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Blockchain tags: </span><span>Blockchain: Ethereum</span></div><div class=\"tag-list\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Tech tags: </span><span>NFT, blockchain gaming</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"timeline-entry odd\"><div class=\"timeline-icon purple\"><div class=\"icon-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/icons/wtf.png\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" layout=\"fill\"/></div></div><div class=\"timeline-description\"><div class=\"entry-wrapper\"><div class=\"timestamp-and-link-icons\"><span class=\"timestamp\"><time dateTime=\"2022-03-04\">March 4, 2022</time></span><ul class=\"entry-link-icons\"><a href=\"/?id=2022-03-04-1\"><i class=\"fas fa-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span></a><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/web3isgreat/status/1500563751807950857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"Tweet link\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-twitter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"sr-only\">Tweet link</span></a></li></ul></div><h2><a id=\"2022-03-04-1\" href=\"/?id=2022-03-04-1\"><span>NeosVR virtual reality project jettisons its crypto component after a team blow-up</span></a></h2><div class=\"captioned-image image-right\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/neosvr_300.webp\" srcSet=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/neosvr_300.webp 1x, https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/neosvr_500.webp 1.5x, https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/neosvr_500.webp 2x\" alt=\"Image from the NeosVR metaverse\" class=\"clickable\"/><span class=\"caption\">NeosVR</span> <span class=\"attribution-link\"><a href=\"/attribution\">(attribution)</a></span></div><div class=\"timeline-body-text-wrapper\"><span>NeosVR, a virtual reality project originally released in 2018, introduced \"Neos Credits\" (NCR) in 2018 with the idea that it could enable in-game transactions. The crypto component was primarily managed by Karel Hulec, one of the project's team members. After cryptocurrencies and metaverse projects experienced a boom in 2021, crypto enthusiasts flooded into the project and drove up the value of the token. Some project members described the influx of people from the crypto community as having a strongly negative effect on the community, with one person writing they brought \"all of its true slur-lovin' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog\" target=\"_blank\">pepe</a>-wearing glory to Neos\". After some discontent within the team about the crypto side of operations, members of the team traded public statements with allegations about other members. On March 4, after Hulec released an updated whitepaper fraudulently (but perhaps mistakenly) \"signed\" by the rest of the team, the project creator and developer announced a proposal to allow Hulec to operate the cryptocurrency \"on top of our work, but as a 3rd party solution, under a company solely under his ownership and direction\", and for the primary team to cease involvement with the crypto component of the project.</span></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frooxius/status/1491880566479892483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Tweet by Frooxius</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srv4o3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Twitlonger by Frooxius</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srv51s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Twitlonger by Karel Hulec</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srvmba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Twitlonger by Frooxius</span></a></li></ul></div><div class=\"entry-footer\"><div><div class=\"tags\"><div class=\"tag-list theme\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Theme tags: </span><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>Bad idea, Hmm</div><div class=\"tag-group-right\"><div class=\"tag-list\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Blockchain tags: </span><span>Blockchain: Ethereum</span></div><div class=\"tag-list\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Tech tags: </span><span>cryptocurrency, metaverse</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"timeline-entry even\"><div class=\"timeline-icon purple\"><div class=\"icon-wrapper\"><i class=\"fas fa-poo\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div></div><div class=\"timeline-description\"><div class=\"entry-wrapper\"><div class=\"timestamp-and-link-icons\"><span class=\"timestamp\"><time dateTime=\"2022-03-04\">March 4, 2022</time></span><ul class=\"entry-link-icons\"><a href=\"/?id=2022-03-04-0\"><i class=\"fas fa-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span></a><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/web3isgreat/status/1500549056602460165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"Tweet link\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-twitter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"sr-only\">Tweet link</span></a></li></ul></div><h2><a id=\"2022-03-04-0\" href=\"/?id=2022-03-04-0\"><span>Tai Lopez releases an exorbitantly-priced NFT project where people can buy access to him</span></a></h2><div class=\"captioned-image image-right\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/tailopeznfts_300.webp\" srcSet=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/tailopeznfts_300.webp 1x, https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/tailopeznfts_500.webp 1.5x, https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/tailopeznfts_500.webp 2x\" alt=\"List of NFTs: &quot;1 on 1 Shadow Tai in Person at His Office\n1 on 1 Michelin Star Restaurant with Tai\n1 on 1 Whatsapp Access to Tai&#x27;s Personal Number\n1 on 1 Private Jet Trip with Tai\n1 on 1 Watch a Movie with Tai\n1 on 1 $10,000 HORSE Basketball game with Tai\n1 on 1 NBA Game Courtside with Tai\n1 on 1 VIP Table at a Top Nightclub with Tai&quot;\" class=\"clickable\"/><span class=\"caption\">Some of the NFTs</span> <span class=\"attribution-link\"><a href=\"/attribution\">(attribution)</a></span></div><div class=\"timeline-body-text-wrapper\"><span>The entrepreneur and motivational speaker Tai Lopez, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1RJTHf5fk\" target=\"_blank\">\"here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini\"</a> fame, announced a new NFT project.

The project describes a \"co-op\" for the local people that will \"unlock generational wealth for these communities\", though there appear to be no plans for these people to actually join the community of \"Guardians\" or have any say in the project's governance. Other economic activity planned by the project apparently involves \"sustainable forestry\", \"empower[ing] local police authorities\", something involving drones, and of course generating carbon offsets for other projects.<p>The whitepaper also addresses that the project will be built on the Ethereum blockchain.

[and] we are required to cancel your current loans\". The email stated that if a borrower was unable to repay their loans by March 15, seven days from the date the email was sent, \"outstanding loans and the associated interest will be automatically repaid\". This seems like a tough timeline for borrowers, whose loans are twelve months long, and given people tend to spend the cash they've borrowed on something, rather than, say, hold on to it in case they need to suddenly repay a loan with a week's notice.Reddit users from the UK, Germany, France, and Switzerland reported receiving the email, and those countries now all appear on the 40-entry-long list of countries not permitted to use Crypto.com's lending services. One Reddit user wrote, \"I have 7 days to pay a big loan, like big. If it gave us a month I could unstake and pay, but no, they give us 7 [days], I will get liquified and can’t do anything for it.\" Other users were confused to receive the email when they didn't have any loans on the platform, as it was worded in a way that they interpreted to mean they did.\"Crypto.com Tells Loan Customers in 'Excluded' Countries to Repay by March 15\", CoinDeskTweet thread by Bitfinexed\"Just a week after the ‘Earn’ debacle, Crypto.com fucks up again by announcing that anyone with a Crypto Loan needs to repay it within 7 days – or be forcibly liquidated via funds in their Spot Wallet.
