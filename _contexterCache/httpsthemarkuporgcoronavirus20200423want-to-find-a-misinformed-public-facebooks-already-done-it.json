The ad was approved in minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We reached out to Facebook asking about the targeting category on Monday morning. After asking for multiple extensions to formulate a response, company spokesperson Devon Kearns emailed The Markup on Wednesday evening to say that Facebook had eliminated the pseudoscience interest category. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image wp-block-image--screenshot align \" aria-label=\"image\" role=\"group\">\n  <div class=\"image-container\"><div class=\"image-screenshot-credit\">\n        <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit:</span>Facebook Ads Manager</div><picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 491px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/facebook-720x405.jpeg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/facebook-1280x720.jpeg 2x\">\n  <source media=\"(max-width: 490px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/facebook-720x405.jpeg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/facebook-1280x720.jpeg 3x\">\n  <img src=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/facebook-720x405.jpeg\" alt=\"A screenshot of Facebook Ads Manger showing the option to target to users tagged with &#39;interested in pseudoscience&#39;\" class=\"\">\n</picture></div><figcaption>\n      <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Caption:</span>\n      Facebook’s Ads Manager tool. Advertisers could target customers “who have expressed an interest in\" pseudoscience. There were 78,144,970 people included in the category.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear how many advertisers had purchased ads targeting this category of users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Facebook does offer a publicly accessible <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime\" target=\"_blank\">library of ads</a> run on its platform, it does not display which groups are targeted by each ad. However, we do have an idea what at least one ad targeting the group looks like, since an ad for a hat that would supposedly protect my head from cellphone radiation appeared on my Facebook feed on Thursday, April 16. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerns about electromagnetic radiation coming from 5G cellular infrastructure have become a major part of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/52168096\" target=\"_blank\">conspiracy theories</a> swirling around the origin of the coronavirus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Why You’re Seeing This Ad” tab on the ad showed it was displayed because “Lambs is trying to reach people Facebook thinks are interested in Pseudoscience.”</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image  align \" aria-label=\"image\" role=\"group\">\n  <div class=\"image-container\"><picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 491px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/combo-screen-720x392.jpg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/combo-screen-1280x697.jpg 2x\">\n  <source media=\"(max-width: 490px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/combo-screen-720x392.jpg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/combo-screen-1280x697.jpg 3x\">\n  <img src=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2020/04/combo-screen-720x392.jpg\" alt=\"A Screenshot of an ad on Facebook that claims to project heads from cellphone radiation\" class=\"\">\n</picture></div><figcaption>\n      <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Caption:</span>\n      Left: The ad I saw for a hat to protect my head from cellphone radiation.

That targeting, he noted, was done by Facebook independently. “This is Facebook thinking that this particular ad set would be interesting for this demographic, not our doing,” Menard de Calenge wrote in an email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that the company’s target market is “people wanting to mitigate the long-term risks associated with wireless radiation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Pseudoscience” was also one of the interests listed in the ad preferences section of my Facebook profile, possibly because I had recently started looking into the litany of user-created coronavirus conspiracy theory groups on the platform. (Facebook allows users to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ds/preferences/\" target=\"_blank\">review and edit the “interests”</a> that Facebook has assigned to them.) </p>\n\n\n\n  <div id=\"block4\" class=\"promotion print-hidden js-promotion promotion--donate  promotion--has-image promotion--left\" data-promotion=\"donate-report-deeply-and-fix-things-1-202108a\">\n    <div class=\"promotion__inner\" data-href=\"/donate-202109a\">\n        <h2 class=\"promotion__heading\"><a href=\"/donate-202109a\" class=\"promotion__link js-promotion-link\">Report Deeply and Fix Things</a></h2>\n      \n        <a href=\"/donate-202109a\" class=\"js-promotion-link\">\n          <figure class=\"promotion__figure\">\n            \n              <picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 491px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/support_woman_original-360x203.jpg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/support_woman_original-750x422.jpg 2x\">\n  <source media=\"(max-width: 490px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/support_woman_original-750x422.jpg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/support_woman_original-1140x641.jpg 3x\">\n  <img src=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/support_woman_original-360x203.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"promotion__img\">\n</picture>\n            \n          </figure>\n        </a>\n      \n      <div class=\"promotion__content\">\n          <p class=\"promotion__description\">Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things.</p>\n          \n            <a href='/donate-202109a' class='button button--important js-promotion-link' >\n    <span class='button__label button__label--main'>\n        \n        Give Now\n    </span></a>\n          \n        \n        \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington studying how conspiracy theories spread online, said one hallmark of the ecosystem is that people who believe in one conspiracy theory are more likely to be convinced of other conspiracy theories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By offering advertisers the ability to target people who are susceptible to conspiracy theories, she said, Facebook is taking “advantage of this sort of vulnerability that a person has once they’re going down these rabbit holes, both to pull them further down and to monetize that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time Facebook has faced scrutiny for the ways its ad tool can target conspiracy-minded people. A 2019 Guardian investigation found that advertisers could reach people interested in “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/15/facebook-anti-vaccination-advertising-targeting-controversy\" target=\"_blank\">vaccine controversies</a>.” In 2017, ProPublica reporters (<a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/julia-angwin\">two of whom are now </a><a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/maddy-varner\">at The Markup</a>) found that advertisers could target people who were interested in terms like “<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\" target=\"_blank\">Jew hater</a>,” and “History of ‘why jews ruin the world.’ ” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/combatting-vaccine-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">both</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10159255449515177\" target=\"_blank\">cases</a>, Facebook removed the ad categories in question. In response to the ProPublica findings, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a 2017 post that the option to target customers based on the categories in question was “totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears Facebook has maintained a “pseudoscience” ad category group for several years. Data collected by ProPublica reporters (<a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/julia-angwin\">two of whom are now </a><a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/surya-mattu\">at The Markup</a>) in late 2016 shows <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/facebook-ad-categories\" target=\"_blank\">that “Pseudoscience” was an interest</a> that Facebook assigned to its users at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ProPublica’s list also contained categories for “New World Order (conspiracy theory),” “Chemtrail conspiracy theory,” and “Vaccine controversies.” However, none of those three categories are currently accessible through Facebook’s advertising tool, suggesting that at some point the company removed them while leaving Pseudoscience active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As COVID-19 has spread around the world, so have conspiracy theories about its origins. Alongside speculation that the virus was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/16/what-caused-coronavirus-skeptical-take-theories-about-outbreaks-chinese-origin/\" target=\"_blank\">created</a> in a Chinese laboratory or is the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/technology/bill-gates-virus-conspiracy-theories.html\" target=\"_blank\">handiwork</a> of billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, rumors have spread widely online about the disease actually being a side effect of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/04/20/dispelling-belief-5-g-networks-spreading-coronavirus/5148961002/\" target=\"_blank\">exposure to the 5G cellular networks</a> that have begun to be deployed across the globe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is <a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/experts-dismiss-claims-5g-wireless-technology-created-novel-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">no scientific evidence</a> to support any connection between the coronavirus and 5G deployment, that has not stopped vandals in the U.K. from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\" target=\"_blank\">setting fire</a> to at least 20 cell towers, which acts law enforcement authorities have blamed on the conspiracy theories. The link between coronavirus and 5G has also been publicly endorsed by <a href=\"https://www.codastory.com/waronscience/celebrities-5g-conspiracies/\" target=\"_blank\">celebrities</a> such as actors Woody Harrelson and John Cusack and musicians M.I.A. and Wiz Khalifa. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though a link between 5G and coronavirus is one people purchasing Lambs’s products may be making, it is not one that the company wants to encourage. “Lambs has never made any connection between 5G and COVID-19,” Menard de Calenge insisted. “In fact, I have actually recently made clear on a podcast that we believe the theories going on about the relationship between 5G and COVID-19 are completely baseless.”</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"pull-number print-hidden  pull-number--has-source\" role=\"complementary\">\n  <div class=\"pull-number__content\">\n    <h3 class=\"pull-number__figure\">67</h3>\n    <p class=\"pull-number__description\">User-created groups whose titles indicate they are devoted to propagating coronavirus conspiracy theories</p>\n  </div>\n  \n    <p class=\"pull-number__source\">\n      <span class=\"pull-number__source-label\">Source: The Markup</span>\n    </p>\n  \n</div>\n\n\n<p>Although Facebook says it is cracking down on conspiracy theory content, as of last week, The Markup was able to find at least 67 user-created groups whose titles directly indicate they are specifically devoted to propagating coronavirus conspiracy theories. Kearns, the Facebook spokesperson, told The Markup that the company is in the process of reviewing the groups we identified. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, one of those Facebook groups changed its name from “CoronaVirus Conspiracy Theories and Discussion Group” to “NOVELTY AND ASIAN PLATES FOR SALE GROUP UK” because, as one administrator of the group wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday, the group had received five warnings from Facebook for spreading misinformation, and the change was an attempt at misdirection. “i hope people understand why i reduced the risk by removing the title (it probably won’t work anyway), but it’s worth a go,” the admin wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/facebook_coronavirus_misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> by the nonprofit advocacy group Avaaz found that 104 pieces of content it had identified as spreading false or misleading information about coronavirus had been viewed by the platform’s users more than 117 million times. Of the 41 percent of that content still active on the site, nearly two-thirds had been debunked by Facebook’s own fact-checking partners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook has also said that it is cracking down on ads on products related to the pandemic. “We recently implemented a policy to prohibit ads that refer to the coronavirus and create a sense of urgency, like implying a limited supply, or guaranteeing a cure or prevention. We also have policies for surfaces like Marketplace that prohibit similar behavior,” a company spokesperson wrote in a February <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-corona-virus-cracks-down-ads-2020-2\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> to Business Insider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/facebook-approved-ads-with-coronavirus-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Reports was able to schedule seven paid ads that contained fake claims</a>, such as stating that social distancing doesn’t work or that people could stay healthy by drinking small doses of bleach. Facebook approved all of the ads.</p></div>\n        <div class=\"article-donate js-promotion print-hidden\">\n          <div class=\"article-donate__content\"><div class='article-donate__body'>\n                <figure class=\"article-donate__visual video-loop-wrapper\">\n                  \n                    <picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 491px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-720x113.jpg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-1280x200.jpg 2x\">\n  <source media=\"(max-width: 490px)\" srcset=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-720x113.jpg, https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-1280x200.jpg 3x\">\n  <img src=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-720x113.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"\">\n</picture>\n                  \n                    <div class=\"js-video-loop article-donate__video uses-motion\" data-desktop=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-1152.mp4\"  data-mobile=\"https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2021/11/banner-688.mp4\" data-href=\"/donate-footer\"></div>\n                  </figure>\n              <p>How did we do that?</p>\n<p>Independent journalism.

A 2019 Guardian investigation found that advertisers could reach people interested in “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/15/facebook-anti-vaccination-advertising-targeting-controversy\" target=\"_blank\">vaccine controversies</a>.” In 2017, ProPublica reporters (<a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/julia-angwin\">two of whom are now </a><a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/maddy-varner\">at The Markup</a>) found that advertisers could target people who were interested in terms like “<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\" target=\"_blank\">Jew hater</a>,” and “History of ‘why jews ruin the world.’&nbsp;”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/combatting-vaccine-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\">both</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10159255449515177\" target=\"_blank\">cases</a>, Facebook removed the ad categories in question. In response to the ProPublica findings, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a 2017 post that the option to target customers based on the categories in question was “totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears Facebook has maintained a “pseudoscience” ad category group for several years. Data collected by ProPublica reporters (<a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/julia-angwin\">two of whom are now </a><a href=\"https://themarkup.org/people/surya-mattu\">at The Markup</a>) in late 2016 shows <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/facebook-ad-categories\" target=\"_blank\">that “Pseudoscience” was an interest</a> that Facebook assigned to its users at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ProPublica’s list also contained categories for “New World Order (conspiracy theory),” “Chemtrail conspiracy theory,” and “Vaccine controversies.” However, none of those three categories are currently accessible through Facebook’s advertising tool, suggesting that at some point the company removed them while leaving Pseudoscience active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As COVID-19 has spread around the world, so have conspiracy theories about its origins.
