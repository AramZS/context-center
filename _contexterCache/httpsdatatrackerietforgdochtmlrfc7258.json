Pervasive Monitoring Is a Widespread Attack on Privacy</span>\n\n   Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is widespread (and often covert)\n   surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts,\n   including application content, or protocol metadata such as headers.\n   Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g., correlation,\n   timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic\n   keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive\n   monitoring.  PM is distinguished by being indiscriminate and very\n   large scale, rather than by introducing new types of technical\n   compromise.\n\n   The IETF community&#x27;s technical assessment is that PM is an attack on\n   the privacy of Internet users and organisations.  The IETF community\n   has expressed strong agreement that PM is an attack that needs to be\n   mitigated where possible, via the design of protocols that make PM\n   significantly more expensive or infeasible.  Pervasive monitoring was\n   discussed at the technical plenary of the November 2013 IETF meeting\n   [<a href=\"#ref-IETF88Plenary\">IETF88Plenary</a>] and then through extensive exchanges on IETF mailing\n   lists.  This document records the IETF community&#x27;s consensus and\n   establishes the technical nature of PM.\n\n   The term &quot;attack&quot; is used here in a technical sense that differs\n   somewhat from common English usage.  In common English usage, an\n   attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended\n   to enforce the opponent&#x27;s will on the attacked party.  The term is\n   used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of\n   communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.  An\n   attack may change the content of the communication, record the\n   content or external characteristics of the communication, or through\n   correlation with other communication events, reveal information the\n   parties did not intend to be revealed.  It may also have other\n   effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.\n   [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc4949\" title=\"&quot;Internet Security Glossary, Version 2&quot;\">RFC4949</a>] contains a more complete definition for the term &quot;attack&quot;.\n   We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality\n   may consist of a multifaceted set of coordinated attacks.\n\n   In particular, the term &quot;attack&quot;, used technically, implies nothing\n   about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.  The\n   motivation for PM can range from non-targeted nation-state\n   surveillance, to legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes by commercial\n   enterprises, to illegal actions by criminals.  The same techniques to\n   achieve PM can be used regardless of motivation.  Thus, we cannot\n   defend against the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by\n   other actors no matter how benevolent some might consider them to be,\n   since the actions required of the attacker are indistinguishable from\n   other attacks.  The motivation for PM is, therefore, not relevant for\n   how PM is mitigated in IETF protocols.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Farrell &amp; Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 2]</span></pre>\n<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id=\"page-3\" ></span>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"/doc/html/rfc7258\">RFC 7258</a>            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-2\" href=\"#section-2\">2</a>.  The IETF Will Work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring</span>\n\n   &quot;Mitigation&quot; is a technical term that does not imply an ability to\n   completely prevent or thwart an attack.  Protocols that mitigate PM\n   will not prevent the attack but can significantly change the threat.\n   (See the diagram on page 24 of <a href=\"/doc/html/rfc4949\">RFC 4949</a> for how the terms &quot;attack&quot;\n   and &quot;threat&quot; are related.)  This can significantly increase the cost\n   of attacking, force what was covert to be overt, or make the attack\n   more likely to be detected, possibly later.\n\n   IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet\n   communications and there are guidelines [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc3552\" title=\"&quot;Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations&quot;\">RFC3552</a>] for applying these\n   in protocol design.  But those standards generally do not address PM,\n   the confidentiality of protocol metadata, countering traffic\n   analysis, or data minimisation.  In all cases, there will remain some\n   privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by\n   protocols.  As technology advances, techniques that were once only\n   available to extremely well-funded actors become more widely\n   accessible.  Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide\n   range of similar attacks.\n\n   It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties\n   of our standards.  The IETF will work to mitigate the technical\n   aspects of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.\n   The ways in which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as\n   mitigation and attack techniques evolve and so are not described\n   here.\n\n   Those developing IETF specifications need to be able to describe how\n   they have considered PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work\n   to be published, be able to justify related design decisions.  This\n   does not mean a new &quot;pervasive monitoring considerations&quot; section is\n   needed in IETF documentation.  It means that, if asked, there needs\n   to be a good answer to the question &quot;Is pervasive monitoring relevant\n   to this work and if so, how has it been considered?&quot;\n\n   In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing\n   technology is reused, may significantly impact the vulnerability of a\n   protocol to PM.  Those developing IETF specifications therefore need\n   to consider mitigating PM when making architectural decisions.\n   Getting adequate, early review of architectural decisions including\n   whether appropriate mitigation of PM can be made is important.\n   Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the process is very\n   costly.\n\n   While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit the\n   definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any attack, e.g.,\n   network management functions monitor packets or flows and anti-spam\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Farrell &amp; Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 3]</span></pre>\n<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id=\"page-4\" ></span>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"/doc/html/rfc7258\">RFC 7258</a>            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014</span>\n\n\n   mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some monitoring can\n   even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example, certificate\n   transparency [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc6962\" title=\"&quot;Certificate Transparency&quot;\">RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring Public Key Infrastructure\n   in ways that could detect some PM attack techniques.  However, there\n   is clear potential for monitoring mechanisms to be abused for PM, so\n   this tension needs careful consideration in protocol design.  Making\n   networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome,\n   but ignoring PM would go against the consensus documented here.  An\n   appropriate balance will emerge over time as real instances of this\n   tension are considered.\n\n   Finally, the IETF, as a standards development organisation, does not\n   control the implementation or deployment of our specifications\n   (though IETF participants do develop many implementations), nor does\n   the IETF standardise all layers of the protocol stack.  Moreover, the\n   non-technical (e.g., legal and political) aspects of mitigating\n   pervasive monitoring are outside of the scope of the IETF.  The\n   broader Internet community will need to step forward to tackle PM, if\n   it is to be fully addressed.\n\n   To summarise: current capabilities permit some actors to monitor\n   content and metadata across the Internet at a scale never before\n   seen.  This pervasive monitoring is an attack on Internet privacy.\n   The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate\n   pervasive monitoring attacks.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-3\" href=\"#section-3\">3</a>.

Pervasive Monitoring Is a Widespread Attack on Privacy</span>\n\n   Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is widespread (and often covert)\n   surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts,\n   including application content, or protocol metadata such as headers.\n   Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g., correlation,\n   timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic\n   keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive\n   monitoring.  PM is distinguished by being indiscriminate and very\n   large scale, rather than by introducing new types of technical\n   compromise.\n\n   The IETF community's technical assessment is that PM is an attack on\n   the privacy of Internet users and organisations.  The IETF community\n   has expressed strong agreement that PM is an attack that needs to be\n   mitigated where possible, via the design of protocols that make PM\n   significantly more expensive or infeasible.  Pervasive monitoring was\n   discussed at the technical plenary of the November 2013 IETF meeting\n   [<a href=\"#ref-IETF88Plenary\">IETF88Plenary</a>] and then through extensive exchanges on IETF mailing\n   lists.  This document records the IETF community's consensus and\n   establishes the technical nature of PM.\n\n   The term \"attack\" is used here in a technical sense that differs\n   somewhat from common English usage.  In common English usage, an\n   attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended\n   to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked party.  The term is\n   used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of\n   communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.  An\n   attack may change the content of the communication, record the\n   content or external characteristics of the communication, or through\n   correlation with other communication events, reveal information the\n   parties did not intend to be revealed.  It may also have other\n   effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.\n   [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc4949\" title=\"&quot;Internet Security Glossary, Version 2&quot;\">RFC4949</a>] contains a more complete definition for the term \"attack\".\n   We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality\n   may consist of a multifaceted set of coordinated attacks.\n\n   In particular, the term \"attack\", used technically, implies nothing\n   about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.  The\n   motivation for PM can range from non-targeted nation-state\n   surveillance, to legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes by commercial\n   enterprises, to illegal actions by criminals.  The same techniques to\n   achieve PM can be used regardless of motivation.  Thus, we cannot\n   defend against the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by\n   other actors no matter how benevolent some might consider them to be,\n   since the actions required of the attacker are indistinguishable from\n   other attacks.  The motivation for PM is, therefore, not relevant for\n   how PM is mitigated in IETF protocols.\n\n\n\n<span>Farrell &amp; Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 2]</span></pre>\n<hr><!--NewPage--><pre><span id=\"page-3\"></span>\n<span><a href=\"/doc/html/rfc7258\">RFC 7258</a>            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014</span>\n\n\n<span><a id=\"section-2\" href=\"#section-2\">2</a>.  The IETF Will Work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring</span>\n\n   \"Mitigation\" is a technical term that does not imply an ability to\n   completely prevent or thwart an attack.  Protocols that mitigate PM\n   will not prevent the attack but can significantly change the threat.\n   (See the diagram on page 24 of <a href=\"/doc/html/rfc4949\">RFC 4949</a> for how the terms \"attack\"\n   and \"threat\" are related.)  This can significantly increase the cost\n   of attacking, force what was covert to be overt, or make the attack\n   more likely to be detected, possibly later.\n\n   IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet\n   communications and there are guidelines [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc3552\" title=\"&quot;Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations&quot;\">RFC3552</a>] for applying these\n   in protocol design.  But those standards generally do not address PM,\n   the confidentiality of protocol metadata, countering traffic\n   analysis, or data minimisation.  In all cases, there will remain some\n   privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by\n   protocols.  As technology advances, techniques that were once only\n   available to extremely well-funded actors become more widely\n   accessible.  Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide\n   range of similar attacks.\n\n   It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties\n   of our standards.  The IETF will work to mitigate the technical\n   aspects of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.\n   The ways in which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as\n   mitigation and attack techniques evolve and so are not described\n   here.\n\n   Those developing IETF specifications need to be able to describe how\n   they have considered PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work\n   to be published, be able to justify related design decisions.  This\n   does not mean a new \"pervasive monitoring considerations\" section is\n   needed in IETF documentation.  It means that, if asked, there needs\n   to be a good answer to the question \"Is pervasive monitoring relevant\n   to this work and if so, how has it been considered?\"\n\n   In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing\n   technology is reused, may significantly impact the vulnerability of a\n   protocol to PM.  Those developing IETF specifications therefore need\n   to consider mitigating PM when making architectural decisions.\n   Getting adequate, early review of architectural decisions including\n   whether appropriate mitigation of PM can be made is important.\n   Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the process is very\n   costly.\n\n   While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit the\n   definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any attack, e.g.,\n   network management functions monitor packets or flows and anti-spam\n\n\n\n<span>Farrell &amp; Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 3]</span></pre>\n<hr><!--NewPage--><pre><span id=\"page-4\"></span>\n<span><a href=\"/doc/html/rfc7258\">RFC 7258</a>            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014</span>\n\n\n   mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some monitoring can\n   even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example, certificate\n   transparency [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc6962\" title=\"&quot;Certificate Transparency&quot;\">RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring Public Key Infrastructure\n   in ways that could detect some PM attack techniques.

Pervasive Monitoring Is a Widespread Attack on Privacy\n\n   Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is widespread (and often covert)\n   surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts,\n   including application content, or protocol metadata such as headers.\n   Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g., correlation,\n   timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic\n   keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive\n   monitoring.  PM is distinguished by being indiscriminate and very\n   large scale, rather than by introducing new types of technical\n   compromise.\n\n   The IETF community's technical assessment is that PM is an attack on\n   the privacy of Internet users and organisations.  The IETF community\n   has expressed strong agreement that PM is an attack that needs to be\n   mitigated where possible, via the design of protocols that make PM\n   significantly more expensive or infeasible.  Pervasive monitoring was\n   discussed at the technical plenary of the November 2013 IETF meeting\n   [IETF88Plenary] and then through extensive exchanges on IETF mailing\n   lists.  This document records the IETF community's consensus and\n   establishes the technical nature of PM.\n\n   The term \"attack\" is used here in a technical sense that differs\n   somewhat from common English usage.  In common English usage, an\n   attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended\n   to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked party.  The term is\n   used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of\n   communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.  An\n   attack may change the content of the communication, record the\n   content or external characteristics of the communication, or through\n   correlation with other communication events, reveal information the\n   parties did not intend to be revealed.  It may also have other\n   effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.\n   [RFC4949] contains a more complete definition for the term \"attack\".\n   We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality\n   may consist of a multifaceted set of coordinated attacks.\n\n   In particular, the term \"attack\", used technically, implies nothing\n   about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.  The\n   motivation for PM can range from non-targeted nation-state\n   surveillance, to legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes by commercial\n   enterprises, to illegal actions by criminals.  The same techniques to\n   achieve PM can be used regardless of motivation.  Thus, we cannot\n   defend against the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by\n   other actors no matter how benevolent some might consider them to be,\n   since the actions required of the attacker are indistinguishable from\n   other attacks.  The motivation for PM is, therefore, not relevant for\n   how PM is mitigated in IETF protocols.\n\n\n\nFarrell & Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 2]\n\nRFC 7258            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014\n\n\n2.  The IETF Will Work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring\n\n   \"Mitigation\" is a technical term that does not imply an ability to\n   completely prevent or thwart an attack.  Protocols that mitigate PM\n   will not prevent the attack but can significantly change the threat.\n   (See the diagram on page 24 of RFC 4949 for how the terms \"attack\"\n   and \"threat\" are related.)  This can significantly increase the cost\n   of attacking, force what was covert to be overt, or make the attack\n   more likely to be detected, possibly later.\n\n   IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet\n   communications and there are guidelines [RFC3552] for applying these\n   in protocol design.  But those standards generally do not address PM,\n   the confidentiality of protocol metadata, countering traffic\n   analysis, or data minimisation.  In all cases, there will remain some\n   privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by\n   protocols.  As technology advances, techniques that were once only\n   available to extremely well-funded actors become more widely\n   accessible.  Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide\n   range of similar attacks.\n\n   It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties\n   of our standards.  The IETF will work to mitigate the technical\n   aspects of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.\n   The ways in which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as\n   mitigation and attack techniques evolve and so are not described\n   here.\n\n   Those developing IETF specifications need to be able to describe how\n   they have considered PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work\n   to be published, be able to justify related design decisions.  This\n   does not mean a new \"pervasive monitoring considerations\" section is\n   needed in IETF documentation.  It means that, if asked, there needs\n   to be a good answer to the question \"Is pervasive monitoring relevant\n   to this work and if so, how has it been considered?\"\n\n   In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing\n   technology is reused, may significantly impact the vulnerability of a\n   protocol to PM.  Those developing IETF specifications therefore need\n   to consider mitigating PM when making architectural decisions.\n   Getting adequate, early review of architectural decisions including\n   whether appropriate mitigation of PM can be made is important.\n   Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the process is very\n   costly.\n\n   While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit the\n   definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any attack, e.g.,\n   network management functions monitor packets or flows and anti-spam\n\n\n\nFarrell & Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 3]\n\nRFC 7258            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014\n\n\n   mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some monitoring can\n   even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example, certificate\n   transparency [RFC6962] involves monitoring Public Key Infrastructure\n   in ways that could detect some PM attack techniques.  However, there\n   is clear potential for monitoring mechanisms to be abused for PM, so\n   this tension needs careful consideration in protocol design.  Making\n   networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome,\n   but ignoring PM would go against the consensus documented here.  An\n   appropriate balance will emerge over time as real instances of this\n   tension are considered.\n\n   Finally, the IETF, as a standards development organisation, does not\n   control the implementation or deployment of our specifications\n   (though IETF participants do develop many implementations), nor does\n   the IETF standardise all layers of the protocol stack.  Moreover, the\n   non-technical (e.g., legal and political) aspects of mitigating\n   pervasive monitoring are outside of the scope of the IETF.  The\n   broader Internet community will need to step forward to tackle PM, if\n   it is to be fully addressed.\n\n   To summarise: current capabilities permit some actors to monitor\n   content and metadata across the Internet at a scale never before\n   seen.  This pervasive monitoring is an attack on Internet privacy.\n   The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate\n   pervasive monitoring attacks.\n\n3.  Process Note\n\n   In the past, architectural statements of this sort, e.g., [RFC1984]\n   and [RFC2804], have been published as joint products of the Internet\n   Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet Architecture Board\n   (IAB).  However, since those documents were published, the IETF and\n   IAB have separated their publication \"streams\" as described in\n   [RFC4844] and [RFC5741].  This document was initiated after\n   discussions in both the IESG and IAB, but is published as an IETF-\n   stream consensus document, in order to ensure that it properly\n   reflects the consensus of the IETF community as a whole.\n\n4.  Security Considerations\n\n   This document is entirely about privacy.  More information about the\n   relationship between security and privacy threats can be found in\n   [RFC6973].  Section 5.1.1 of [RFC6973] specifically addresses\n   surveillance as a combined security-privacy threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarrell & Tschofenig      Best Current Practice                 [Page 4]\n\nRFC 7258            Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack           May 2014\n\n\n5.
