Bing and you’ll get paragraphs upon paragraphs of cleverly written responses being drawn from a variety of undisclosed sources from across the internet. </p>\n<p>When <em>The Current</em> prompted ChatGPT to answer the question “Are chatbots a threat to news sites?” the response was crystal clear: “The adoption of AI chatbots could change the way users interact with news content, leading to a shift in ad revenue models that news publishers may not be prepared for.” </p>\n<p>Publishers are indeed fearful about how AI chatbot technology could cannibalize their content and, in return, their revenue. While some hope these chatbots will bring about a new era of innovation, with customized reader experiences and data-based insights, others acknowledge the technology’s threats and limitations. </p>\n<p>“If AI-driven search is not effective at driving traffic to original content, it has the potential to undermine the media industry entirely,” Nick Shelton, founder and director of Australian culture publication <em>Broadsheet</em>, tells <em>The Current</em>. “I’m hopeful that the relevant stakeholders — AI and search, industry, media industry, and governments — recognize what’s at stake and are motivated to align incentives.” </p>\n<h2 class=\"type-epsilon\"><strong>Chatbots could affect a publisher’s page views </strong></h2>\n<p>Chatbot developers say the technology gives publishers advantages such as data-driven insights, better customer engagement, and personalized experiences. Chatbots can also quickly answer questions that readers search for online, potentially cutting into publishers’ search traffic for evergreen content. Search-based traffic could take a hit, and ad impressions and revenue along with it. </p>\n<p>Publications’ ability to drive SEO with a trusted editorial voice and expertise will continue to be “crucial” to safeguard publishers against search competition, according to Sophia Wilcox, head of brand and culture at indie media house <em>Urban List</em>. </p>\n<p>For example, Wilcox explains, publishers like <em>Urban List</em> are on the ground in their cities, searching for great new venues, products, and services. They’re building relationships with business owners and entrepreneurs, writing articles, and shooting videos before anyone has heard about them or knows to “search” for them. Chatbots can’t see what’s coming — “that’s our advantage,” she says. </p>\n<p>“There will always be a need and a place for excellent and original content, great interviews, and editor-led, trusted recommendations,” she adds. </p>\n<p>The major limitation of chatbots or large language models is their inability to anticipate emerging trends, cultural shifts, and movements. They can only respond with and provide insights on past events, and lack real-time access to internet content, which hinders their effectiveness, says Wilcox.</p>\n<p>“Some publishers provide something ChatGPT can’t: trust,” she explains. “This trust gives readers the confidence in the buying-and-booking choices they make. Trust will remain something a chatbot can’t replicate.” </p>\n<p>If a publisher asked ChatGPT to write an article on the best Italian restaurants in Sydney, for example, the chatbot cannot distinguish between restaurants that get a lot of web traffic and those adored by culture seekers. In other words, it spots quantity better than quality, giving in-the-know publications like <em>Urban List</em> a leg up. </p>\n<p>Even if someone conducts their initial search on ChatGPT, discerning foodies will still need to validate whether the restaurant will appeal to their personal tastes, not to mention if the establishment is even open. To date, ChatGPT only accesses data up to 2021. </p>\n<h2 class=\"type-epsilon\"><strong>Publishers could reap advantages from chatbots powered by AI </strong></h2>\n<p>Wilcox notes, however, that if chatbots take over the role that Google search currently plays, it may not be bad for all publishers, citing there are potential positives to the role it can play within the sector. </p>\n<p>“Publishers should see an opportunity to capture more commercial and audience market share, as platforms whose content is more at risk of being cannibalized by AI and the changing search environment [may] lose click-through traffic and associated advertising spend,” says Wilcox. </p>\n<p>“Because of the highly changeable cultural environment that a platform (like <em>Urban List</em>) covers, the specificity of the content, and the high levels of opinion and curation involved, AI technologies will most likely serve to elevate brands like <em>Urban List</em>,” she says. </p>\n<p>While it’s far from clear how search and traffic referral are going to look in the future, what is clear is that generative AI is going to force a huge evolution of the industry. From a regulation standpoint, Wilcox believes that the tech giants and government regulators “must move with pace to ensure that all publishers are protected and the content they produce is not aggregated and distributed for free.”  </p></div><section class=\"subscribe-form py-6 border-y border-dark-blue-opacity \" data-component=\"SubscribeBlock\"><div class=\"mx-auto w-full lg:max-w-6xl

While some hope these chatbots will bring about a new era of innovation, with customized reader experiences and data-based insights, others acknowledge the technology’s threats and limitations. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“If AI-driven search is not effective at driving traffic to original content, it has the potential to undermine the media industry entirely,” Nick Shelton, founder and director of Australian culture publication \\u003cem\\u003eBroadsheet\\u003c/em\\u003e, tells \\u003cem\\u003eThe Current\\u003c/em\\u003e. “I’m hopeful that the relevant stakeholders — AI and search, industry, media industry, and governments — recognize what’s at stake and are motivated to align incentives.” \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eChatbots could affect a publisher’s page views \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eChatbot developers say the technology gives publishers advantages such as data-driven insights, better customer engagement, and personalized experiences. Chatbots can also quickly answer questions that readers search for online, potentially cutting into publishers’ search traffic for evergreen content. Search-based traffic could take a hit, and ad impressions and revenue along with it. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePublications’ ability to drive SEO with a trusted editorial voice and expertise will continue to be “crucial” to safeguard publishers against search competition, according to Sophia Wilcox, head of brand and culture at indie media house \\u003cem\\u003eUrban List\\u003c/em\\u003e. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor example, Wilcox explains, publishers like \\u003cem\\u003eUrban List\\u003c/em\\u003e are on the ground in their cities, searching for great new venues, products, and services. They’re building relationships with business owners and entrepreneurs, writing articles, and shooting videos before anyone has heard about them or knows to “search” for them. Chatbots can’t see what’s coming — “that’s our advantage,” she says. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“There will always be a need and a place for excellent and original content, great interviews, and editor-led, trusted recommendations,” she adds. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe major limitation of chatbots or large language models is their inability to anticipate emerging trends, cultural shifts, and movements. They can only respond with and provide insights on past events, and lack real-time access to internet content, which hinders their effectiveness, says Wilcox.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“Some publishers provide something ChatGPT can’t: trust,” she explains. “This trust gives readers the confidence in the buying-and-booking choices they make. Trust will remain something a chatbot can’t replicate.” \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIf a publisher asked ChatGPT to write an article on the best Italian restaurants in Sydney, for example, the chatbot cannot distinguish between restaurants that get a lot of web traffic and those adored by culture seekers.

Zoom in, and you can see how streaming content, journalism, and retail sites stay up and running in large part thanks to advertising revenue and the open flow of data showing how content and advertising perform. And that’s why the David and Goliath battle between the open internet and walled gardens is taking center stage.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs Willie Jackson, executive VP of data strategy at media agency Starcom, puts it: The open internet works to shield the media ecosystem from monopolistic power.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“It shifts the conversation to being a collaboration as opposed to a directive,” Jackson tells \\u003cem\\u003eThe Current\\u003c/em\\u003e. “If you go into a walled garden, you have a very limited say in how you steward your [ad] dollars. It’s a fairly self-contained ecosystem, and they set the rules of engagement. The open web creates an opportunity to identify where you want to be and how you want to show up in those environments.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJackson, who was named to \\u003cem\\u003eAd Age\\u003c/em\\u003e’s \\u003ca href=\\\"https://adage.com/article/special-report-40-under-40/40-under-40-willie-jackson-executive-vp-data-strategy-starcom/2428016\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\u003e40 Under 40 list\\u003c/a\\u003e, believes the COVID-19 pandemic spurred brands to reflect on the power dynamic they face with walled gardens and consider where consumers in the U.S. are actually spending time online. In 2020, the average American spent \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294563/time-spent-ad-spend-open-internet-walled-gardens-usa/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\u003e66 percent\\u003c/a\\u003e of their time on the open internet, according to consumer data company Statista. However, 60 percent of ad spend still went to walled gardens that year. Jackson suggests more brands will examine this as they seek more oversight into their campaigns. \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e“Brands feel like they should have more control than they’ve ever had before,” Jackson says. “For a period of time, people [accepted] this is just how it works when you work with Google or with Amazon. And I think people are holding those platforms’ feet to the fire and saying, ‘If you can’t get [the insights I need] to me, I have a viable alternative now.’” \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eOne aspect of this is the proliferation of alternative identity solutions that unlock first-party data while protecting privacy, which challenges the deterministic log-in data that long gave walled gardens an upper hand in advertising. Leveraging first-party data is only becoming more important with the expected end of third-party cookies on the horizon and as environments that are not dependent on cookies — like streaming TV, mobile, and audio — continue to rapidly grow. \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePowering \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003es\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003etreaming\\u003c/strong\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003eThe open internet has also allowed upstart brands like Tastemade to enter the streaming space. Consumers can nourish their content cravings through the lifestyle, food, and travel brand’s multiple free ad-supported television (FAST) channels and video on demand (VOD) programs. \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e“Previously, the capital investment to be able to start a linear channel meant that there were just not that many people who could do it,” Evan Bregman, Tastemade’s general manager of streaming, tells \\u003cem\\u003eThe Current\\u003c/em\\u003e. “In a land of infinity, there’s a lot of opportunity to take advantage of a long tail of viewership that is really big and create a more personalized offering, because there are consumers out there who want lots of different things. We can provide a lot to them.” \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eAn open flow of data is the lifeblood to how Tastemade operates, influencing the content it produces and even how its shows are edited. \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e“At the end of the day, we as providers of content will only do better if we know a lot about how our content is performing and how our businesses are performing,” Bregman says. “The same thing then goes on the ad side.

Ebiquity executive Ruben Schreurs launched Brands4News this year as an open-source resource completely self-funded by Schreurs and a handful of other people. The upstart brand supports advertisers by giving them free templates to see how their ads will look on a news site. \\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003e“There is high effectiveness to be gained for advertisers in high-quality context if the right, considerate approach is taken to investing in this media,” Schreurs tells \\u003cem\\u003eThe Current\\u003c/em\\u003e. “So it’s not a zero-sum game, where they have to decide, ‘Well, if we invest 10 percent of our money on quality journalism, that money is down the drain and has no returns for us.’\\u003cbr /\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAdvancing retail media \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003cbr /\\u003eRetail media networks also \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.thecurrent.com/theCurrent/what-the-tech-is-retail-media-and-shopper-marketing\\\"\\u003econnect advertisers\\u003c/a\\u003e with much-valued first-party data, which has revolutionized the open internet.

Think of how often we “google” something. Think of the deeply personal things we search every day, such as medical conditions or financial advice. Most of us trust Google with our most sensitive thoughts. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTrusting Google Search is only the beginning. Gmail has almost 2 billion active users using 105 languages, and 27 percent of all email opened on the global internet is in Gmail. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYouTube is even more dominant, with over 2.5 billion monthly active users. That’s just over one quarter of the world’s population. According to my Google search (I know), only 53 percent of the world has fast internet. So, if you are alive anywhere in the world with a decent internet connection, you’re probably using YouTube. And most people browsing the internet outside of China use Chrome, Google’s dominant browser. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd we can’t even cover all the other ways Google touches our digital lives with other products, such as Google Cloud, Drive, Photos, Nest Thermostats, Nest Cameras, Nest Smoke Alarms, Android Phones, Pixel Phones, Google Chat, Google Meet, Google Maps, Waze, or Google Calendar. The list goes on. Suffice to say that if you say “OK, Google” out loud, you might awaken some random Google-driven device. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eGoogle recently laid off more than 12,000 employees, some of whom had worked at Google companies for decades. Some were told they had to leave immediately. When employees questioned Google why they were treated so harshly, they were \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/google-ceo-defends-layoff-process-in-heated-town-hall-monday.html\\\"\\u003etold\\u003c/a\\u003e\\n(among other things) that those terminated had to leave abruptly because they had access to sensitive consumer data. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’re trusting Google. We’re trusting Google employees – both current and former employees, including those recently laid off. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI have an exceptionally complicated relationship with Google. Like most people, I use many Google products and I worry about how much of my data they have. Additionally, while my company, The Trade Desk, partners with Google’s Ad Exchange, we are also one of their fiercest remaining competitors. In particular, we compete against their lesser-known DV360 advertising platform. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAt The Trade Desk, we help advertisers buy digital ads in the most technologically advanced manner possible. We buy billions of dollars of advertising every year, and most of it touches Google in some way. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eRight now, governments around the world, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), are assessing Google’s dominance. When Google competes, does it play fair? Good question. The DOJ has clearly done its homework. Some at Google have tried to suggest they’ve been here before because governments have scrutinized them in the past. Reading the complaint, this one is different. The DOJ seems to clearly understand the problems and that the strength of Google’s search product has enabled dominance in other products too. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSome governments, regulators, and industry insiders are also asking which assets Google should keep and what it should spin off. It is natural to jump to such potential remedies. But I believe such an approach obscures the real issues for what is a highly complex, intertwined business. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eGoogle’s empire of amazing products started out as one thing—a search engine, before it became this meshed portfolio of products. YouTube was an acquisition completed eight years after Google’s founding. Everyone knows Google and YouTube, but some of its most ingenious products are business-to-business advertising tools that most consumers have never heard of. Many years ago, Google leveraged its search engine and built an ad product on top of it, AdSense. Renamed and bundled many times since, it’s a product that enables search buyers to buy internet banner and video ads. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBecause of the market dominance of Google Search, when AdSense was launched, it naturally attracted millions of websites to sell their ads. This extension almost instantly turned millions of search advertisers into banner advertisers, expanding the empire. It’s the biggest ad network ever created, and it very likely would never have happened without the Search Engine. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eGoogle’s advertising reach became even more pervasive when it bought a company that selects, measures, and reports on all the ads bought all over the internet —Double Click. It’s like owning the Visa and Mastercard of internet advertising. By owning Double Click, Google now processes most of the ad transactions across the global internet, allegedly with around 90 percent market share. Publishers are extremely dependent on this product. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eGoogle also built a digital ad exchange on top of Double Click. Basically, this is a real-time exchange like NASDAQ, but for digital ads. Because Double Click was so ubiquitous in ad serving and measurement, their exchange also became the market leader very quickly, almost overnight. And then there’s DV360, Google’s ad-buying platform, which buys on the exchange for advertisers. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis aggregation of ad tech capabilities has had many in the industry, including the DOJ, asking if it’s right that one company is essentially the defense, the prosecution, judge, jury, court reporter, the bailiff, and the bondsman for millions of ad transactions every second on the internet – each priced and auctioned in a fraction of a second. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe dangers of such B2B market dominance may be obscure to the consumer, but they are very real. Consider journalism, and the critical role it plays to keep power of all kinds in check, including foreign and domestic governments. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMajor news publishers, such as Gannett, may depend on ads for half of their revenue. Smaller publishers often get \\u003cem\\u003eall\\u003c/em\\u003e their ads and ad services from Google. One can see why many argue that the news media survives at the whim of Google. The fourth estate has always relied on advertising as a critical funding source, and this seismic shift in the dynamics of that funding should concern all of us. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt’s natural to wonder how we got here. The Google Search + AdSense tie is merely the tip of the iceberg. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eUntil a few years ago, it seemed that every Google division operated separately. The strategic thinking seemed reasonable. If Chrome operates separately from the ads business, it won’t optimize to Google ads, or even ads at all. And to all appearances, it worked. In my experience, Chrome engineers didn’t care about ads. They knew ads pay the bills, but they just wanted to build a better, faster browser. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut for advertisers and publishers, the anticompetitive impact accelerated and became pervasive about seven years ago, with the formation of Alphabet and a re-org. Likely in an attempt to win additional favor with Wall Street, Google decided to break out the profitable businesses from the expensive and highly speculative ventures. So, Google tucked nearly all the ad-powered businesses under one umbrella—YouTube, Search, AdX, Double Click, DV360, the ad network previously called AdSense, and others. With this new structure, today, Google’s enterprise sales teams roll up, bundle and sell a massive suite of products. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis created an incentive to exploit power, for both engineers and salespeople. For advertisers and publishers, it seemed that accountability was distributed, and incentives were aggregated. And somewhere along the way, a company that once prided itself on doing no evil, was seemingly operating with a different mantra—win at all costs. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor example, if an advertiser hits a $10 million minimum of ad spend across search, YouTube, DoubleClick, and DV360—Google could give a rebate or a discount. Or there are examples in our industry of advertisers who buy enough Google products for their company and are promised a personal Google smart home for free. Or a news site might not get access to demand from the ad exchange if it doesn’t allow \\u003cem\\u003eDoubleClick for Publishers\\u003c/em\\u003e to decide how to allocate every ad on the site. Or, as alleged in recent lawsuits, Google had a series of secret initiatives, such as Project Bernanke and Project Poirot/Elmo, in which Google will penalize you during the ad-buying process unless you support its ad system over the open market system preferred by publishers. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAnd by giving middle management this incentive and impetus to leverage size and dominance, Google has morphed into something unrecognizable from its origins. It’s comparable to the way that bankers’ individual incentives contributed to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Bank employees had individual incentives to take risks that put the system in jeopardy—a cause and effect that only became clear in retrospect. In both cases, incentives created systemic moral hazard over time. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs we look for answers regarding the aggregation of power at Google, let’s not simply focus on the suggestions to perform corporate surgery and extract assets like DoubleClick. With all the source code, the resources and the history, any of these features and products could be rebuilt. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eInstead, we should look at how we advance an open internet on a fair, level and competitive playing field for everyone with better incentives. Bad incentives created the financial crisis just over a decade ago. Let’s not repeat history and create an anemic internet built around a few too-big-to-fail companies. Let’s fix incentives to ensure no company, including Google, acts as the judge, jury, defense, court reporter, and prosecution for digital advertising transactions. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe future of entrepreneurship, business growth, journalism—and so much more—depends on us making the internet better.\\u003c/p\\u003e\"}}],\"readTime\":8}},\"fulfilledTimeStamp\":1682431177457},\"getArticleData({\\\"slug\\\":\\\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\\\",\\\"token\\\":\\\"\\\"})\":{\"status\":\"rejected\",\"endpointName\":\"getArticleData\",\"requestId\":\"PVSvijXj33OUO2zFf5Aep\",\"originalArgs\":{\"slug\":\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\",\"token\":\"\"},\"startedTimeStamp\":1682431193069,\"error\":{\"status\":404,\"data\":{\"name\":\"Not Found\",\"message\":\"Unable to find an Entry with slug apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\",\"code\":0,\"status\":404}}},\"getArticleData({\\\"slug\\\":\\\"situationships-brands-advertising-europe-dating-culture\\\",\\\"token\\\":\\\"\\\"})\":{\"status\":\"fulfilled\",\"endpointName\":\"getArticleData\",\"requestId\":\"OK1B-r2jSmMaDP4t17kaA\",\"originalArgs\":{\"slug\":\"situationships-brands-advertising-europe-dating-culture\",\"token\":\"\"},\"startedTimeStamp\":1682432447977,\"data\":{\"metadata\":{\"datePosted\":\"2023-01-30T00:00:00-08:00\",\"dateCreated\":\"2023-01-30T10:00:38-08:00\",\"dateUpdated\":\"2023-02-07T13:57:22-08:00\",\"title\":\"Situationships and solitude: How brands are advertising for Europe’s changing dating culture | The Current\",\"description\":\"Some European brands are adapting their advertising to cater to new generations — and winning fans and sales in the process.\",\"image\":{\"alt\":\"A silhouette of the continent of Europe has a speech bubble above it, SMS style, with three hearts in a row.\",\"url\":\"https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/TheCurrent_Edition104_EuropeanDatingAndAdvertising_1920x1080_v1sm.jpg\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080,\"isLandscape\":true},\"imageTwitter\":{\"alt\":\"A silhouette of the continent of Europe has a speech bubble above it, SMS style, with three hearts in a row.\",\"url\":\"https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/TheCurrent_Edition104_EuropeanDatingAndAdvertising_1920x1080_v1sm_2023-01-30-180411_bxyz.jpg\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080,\"isLandscape\":true},\"author\":\"Zac Wang\",\"themes\":[\"Culture\",\"The Latest\"],\"url\":\"https://www.thecurrent.com/situationships-brands-advertising-europe-dating-culture\",\"noIndex\":false},\"data\":{\"id\":1695243,\"slug\":\"situationships-brands-advertising-europe-dating-culture\",\"postDate\":\"2023-01-30T00:00:00-08:00\",\"heading\":\"Situationships and solitude: How brands are advertising for Europe’s changing dating culture\",\"subheading\":null,\"themes\":[{\"id\":692084,\"title\":\"Culture\",\"slug\":\"culture\",\"uri\":\"sections/culture\",\"description\":null},{\"id\":1049784,\"title\":\"The Latest\",\"slug\":\"the-latest\",\"uri\":\"sections/the-latest\",\"description\":\"Get the latest news, trends, and insights shaping the future of digital marketing and programmatic advertising.\"}],\"articleBackgroundColor\":null,\"featuredImage\":{\"alt\":\"A silhouette of the continent of Europe has a speech bubble above it, SMS style, with three hearts in a row.\",\"url\":\"https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/TheCurrent_Edition104_EuropeanDatingAndAdvertising_1920x1080_NoLogo_v1sm.jpg\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080,\"isLandscape\":true},\"featuredMobileImage\":{},\"featuredPreviewImage\":{},\"video\":{},\"youtubeUrl\":null,\"captionLinkable\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eIllustration by Holly Warfield / Getty / The Current\\u003c/p\\u003e\",\"previewImage\":{\"alt\":\"A silhouette of the continent of Europe has a speech bubble above it, SMS style, with three hearts in a row.\",\"url\":\"https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/TheCurrent_Edition104_EuropeanDatingAndAdvertising_1920x1080_NoLogo_v1sm_2023-01-30-180302_aleh.jpg\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080,\"isLandscape\":true},\"metaNoindex\":false,\"author\":{\"id\":1611149,\"slug\":\"zac-wang\",\"fullName\":\"Zac Wang\",\"positionTitle\":null,\"authorType\":\"staff\",\"featuredImage\":{\"alt\":null,\"url\":\"https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/ZacWang_162px_v1.jpg\",\"width\":162,\"height\":162,\"isLandscape\":false},\"contactCollection\":[]},\"components\":[{\"componentType\":\"RichText\",\"content\":{\"copy\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eEurope is transforming.

They are very interested in relationships and how they are evolving as a response to other societal changes,” says Ottavio Nava, regional lead EU area at agency We Are Social. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMany young Europeans are also finding themselves in single-person households \\u003ca href=\\\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Household_composition_statistics#Increasing_number_of_households_composed_of_adults_living_alone\\\"\\u003ewell into their 30s\\u003c/a\\u003e.

So you find people saying, ‘If I’m alone, and I learn to be alone, I have more time to do what I want in my life,’ meaning more time to think about themselves and consume products that are related to that,” says Nava. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut while it can be helpful to rely on generalized insights to understand Europe better, some of the most impactful advertising taps into each nation’s differences to create campaigns that truly resonate.

The company and its agency, Spark Foundry/Publicis Media Precision, launched their first over-the-top (OTT) campaign in the country during Ramadan in 2022, looking to reach a specific demographic: women between 25 and 45 who were likely focused on preparing food for Sahūr, the pre-dawn meal that Muslims have each day during Ramadan before fasting. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTypically, the company ran its Kraft cheese campaigns on a major user-generated content (UGC) platform, so it was able to compare the value of those campaigns against programmatic advertising on OTT platforms. The insights this strategy shift yielded speak to the power of premium content — in this case Korean dramas known as \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.thecurrent.com/what-a-k-drama-superfan-can-teach-publishers-and-brands-about-loyalty\\\"\\u003eK-dramas\\u003c/a\\u003e, especially popular with women of all age groups — to drive reach and relevancy in a focused way. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“The reason we went after Korean drama as a genre is because we know that audiences are actually coming for that specific content and spending time watching it,” says Sindhuja Rai, the senior director of global media investment and AMEA consumer experience for Mondelēz International. “Whereas when you’re looking at short-form video on user-generated platforms, it’s an audience that’s just flicking through and looking for some good snacking content,” she tells \\u003cem\\u003eThe Current\\u003c/em\\u003e. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe campaign — which ran for just over two weeks —reached more than 2.1 million individuals in the country during Ramadan, which was 1.8 times more than the campaign’s KPI goal. With more than 2.6 million completed views and a video completion rate (VCR) of 89 percent across all four OTT platforms — Vidio, Viu, WeTV, and iFlix — the campaign results were eight times higher than results from the UGC platform. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt was a content-forward strategy, says Akshay Brijkrishan, digital lead of the consumer experience for Mondelēz in Southeast Asia. “Our strategy wasn’t based on one OTT platform that was bigger or better than the rest. Our objective was to reach as many people as possible,” he tells \\u003cem\\u003eThe Current\\u003c/em\\u003e. “Everybody’s watching this content from multiple kinds of screens.” \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn some ways, the Mondelēz content-forward campaign is an anomaly within the OTT channel, since it sought its audience at the level of a genre with gravitational pull. Of course, programmatic ad-buying also allows for an audience-first strategy, matching audience segments against first-party data, so that a K-drama fan might be found beyond their proximity to such hits shows as “Dear X Who Doesn’t Love Me” or “The Law Café.” \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor this reason, marketers consider content on streaming television and UGC content as distinct channels. “Our stance in the influencer and UGC world within social and YouTube is that this is meant to build brand love on an audience built around content, whereas segmentation capabilities \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.thecurrent.com/what-the-tech-programmatic-guaranteed-private-marketplace-deals\\\"\\u003ewithin PMP\\u003c/a\\u003e give you the ability to reach audiences wherever they happen to be watching content, but at the right time and place in the consumer journey,” says Carl Strum, a director at Initiative. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMeanwhile, legacy programmers are debating what constitutes premium content. A \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.adexchanger.com/ctv-roundup/will-youtube-win-its-fight-for-premium-video-status/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\u003erecent report\\u003c/a\\u003e indicates that YouTube wants to be considered a competitor within the connected TV space, having joined the upfronts for the first time last year. However, broadcasters are not inclined to embrace UGC as premium content, especially as \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.adexchanger.com/digital-tv/paramount-works-with-rivals-in-the-name-of-cross-platform-tv-measurement/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\u003esome studies\\u003c/a\\u003e indicate that shorter ad exposure generates lower brand recall when compared to 15- and 30-second spots that run on streaming platforms. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe Mondelēz Kraft campaign was illustrative here, according to a Nielsen brand lift study, which compared brand awareness and perceptions held by exposed and non-exposed groups of viewers. The findings indicated an 11.5 percent increase in ad recall, indicating that the campaign was a memorable one. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNo doubt, the surge of premium content across OTT platforms has allowed advertisers a broader palette of streaming TV inventory. “The emergence of CTV/OTT platforms has provided a strong alternative to the audiences and reach previously only available on YouTube. CTV now provides similar scale and targeting, but with the added benefit of brand safety and a much more predictable environment,” says Casey Soulies, VP of digital media at The Shipyard. However, Soulies points out, “while we tend to obsess over content quality, consumers don’t think about video in the form of CTV or UGC, they just view the content that they like.” \\u003c/p\\u003e\"}},{\"componentType\":\"Subscribe\",\"content\":{\"subscribeTheme\":\"midnight\",\"marketoForm\":{\"formId\":\"2571\"},\"blurb\":\"Subscribe to The Current\",\"dictionary\":{\"submitLabel\":null,\"fallbackText\":null},\"tagline\":null}}],\"readTime\":4}},\"fulfilledTimeStamp\":1682432462881},\"getArticleData({\\\"slug\\\":\\\"publishers-fear-chatgpt-undermine-media-industry-entirely\\\",\\\"token\\\":\\\"\\\"})\":{\"status\":\"fulfilled\",\"endpointName\":\"getArticleData\",\"requestId\":\"CdWbxFQEZAiVW217EFT2i\",\"originalArgs\":{\"slug\":\"publishers-fear-chatgpt-undermine-media-industry-entirely\",\"token\":\"\"},\"startedTimeStamp\":1682432464504,\"data\":{\"metadata\":{\"datePosted\":\"2023-03-29T11:17:00-07:00\",\"dateCreated\":\"2023-03-29T09:35:07-07:00\",\"dateUpdated\":\"2023-03-29T11:17:21-07:00\",\"title\":\"Publishers fear ChatGPT will ‘undermine the media industry entirely’ | The Current\",\"description\":\"Publishers are uncertain about the impact that AI-driven chatbots, like ChatGPT from OpenAI, have on the industry.
