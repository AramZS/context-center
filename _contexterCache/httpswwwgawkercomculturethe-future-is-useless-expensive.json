data-adroot class=\"Af fx\"><p>One recurring experience of modern living is unlocking the old smartphone and catching a glimpse of the future, or possible future, as the increasing pace of digital technology unifies global culture and whisks us ever onward into a world our forebears would have considered magical. A dispiriting aspect of this experience is that the magical new world inevitably looks dumb — not dumb in the sense of trivial or easy, since in most cases these new technologies are lobe-shrivelingly difficult to understand, much less invent, but dumb in the sense of deadening and inert at best, and at worst actively annoying, like the world’s most advanced synthesizer with a hamster running across the keys. </p><p>This is how NFTs make me feel: like the future is useless but expensive, and world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.</p><p>Let me give you an example. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanonolennon/status/1466088989786529802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here is what</a> Sean Ono Lennon harnessed the power of an instantaneous global communications network to tweet to his 331,000 followers earlier this month:</p><div class=\"sW iG vr\"><figure class=\"VE lF\"><div class><div class=\"XU\"><blockquote data-tweetid=\"1466088989786529802\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanonolennon/status/1466088989786529802\"></a></blockquote></div></div></figure></div><p>My initial response to this tweet was to reassess Lennon as some kind of genius satirist. Then I got scared, because I think he might not be kidding. SkullxNFT really is an offering of non-fungible tokens that Lennon seems to be earnestly promoting — or at least <em>actually</em> promoting, since the level of earnestness with which a fully socialized adult man (albeit one who grew up in whatever weird nutrient bath the spawn of celebrities grow up in) could regard these images of yelling skulls as “getting serious” is impossible to determine. But they are for sale, and you can buy them. As of this writing, many of the less expensive skull NFTs are available for ETH 0.015, i.e. 0.015 Ethereum, or roughly $61.</p><p>Ethereum is, of course, a cryptocurrency that someone’s boyfriend has likely already told you about. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a different application of the blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency operates: basically, the seller of the NFT’ed image generates a token corresponding to it that only one person can own at any time — the same way only one person can own a given Bitcoin, i.e. symbolically but also reliably due to its documentation on a transaction record (the blockchain) that is not kept on a single server but rather distributed across all peers participating in the blockchain protocol.</p><p>The idea is to create conditions of scarcity and therefore ownership for digital images, so that even though people can still copy your picture of a badass skull guy and paste it somewhere for their own purposes, as I have done, you “own” the image in the sense that you have an incontrovertible claim to having paid money for it, and later you can sell that claim to someone else who regards it as meaningful and important for, presumably, profit. That’s how NFT ownership works: anyone can copy-paste your house, but your name is on the deed, and the metaphorical hall of records can’t burn down or whatever because everyone has copies of the records on a peer-to-peer network they can access via their home computer, which is next to their erotic poster of Sailor Moon.</p><p>Perhaps that generalization is unfair. And yet there is something about the aesthetics of NFTs — not a sameness, exactly, but a particular deficiency of which they all partake, such that even though they look different, they all manage to suck in the same way. It’s tempting to say they suck the way everything sucks now, but it’s more like how one particular strain of American aesthetics has sucked for the last 20 years. NFTs are the human capacity for visual expression as understood by the guy at the vape store. There is the predominance of skulls. There is the melodramatic deployment of the <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/0x1dc5d3b2162f9500d7ddec14eb0ba9ccb43bc20c/3507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">visual language of video games</a>, as if romanticism had been invented by people who never went outside.

A dispiriting aspect of this experience is that the magical new world inevitably looks dumb — not dumb in the sense of trivial or easy, since in most cases these new technologies are lobe-shrivelingly difficult to understand, much less invent, but dumb in the sense of deadening and inert at best, and at worst actively annoying, like the world’s most advanced synthesizer with a hamster running across the keys. </p><p>This is how NFTs make me feel: like the future is useless but expensive, and world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.</p><p>Let me give you an example. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanonolennon/status/1466088989786529802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here is what</a> Sean Ono Lennon harnessed the power of an instantaneous global communications network to tweet to his 331,000 followers earlier this month:</p><p>My initial response to this tweet was to reassess Lennon as some kind of genius satirist. Then I got scared, because I think he might not be kidding. SkullxNFT really is an offering of non-fungible tokens that Lennon seems to be earnestly promoting — or at least <em>actually</em> promoting, since the level of earnestness with which a fully socialized adult man (albeit one who grew up in whatever weird nutrient bath the spawn of celebrities grow up in) could regard these images of yelling skulls as “getting serious” is impossible to determine. But they are for sale, and you can buy them. As of this writing, many of the less expensive skull NFTs are available for ETH 0.015, i.e. 0.015 Ethereum, or roughly $61.</p><p>Ethereum is, of course, a cryptocurrency that someone’s boyfriend has likely already told you about. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a different application of the blockchain technology on which cryptocurrency operates: basically, the seller of the NFT’ed image generates a token corresponding to it that only one person can own at any time — the same way only one person can own a given Bitcoin, i.e. symbolically but also reliably due to its documentation on a transaction record (the blockchain) that is not kept on a single server but rather distributed across all peers participating in the blockchain protocol.</p><p>The idea is to create conditions of scarcity and therefore ownership for digital images, so that even though people can still copy your picture of a badass skull guy and paste it somewhere for their own purposes, as I have done, you “own” the image in the sense that you have an incontrovertible claim to having paid money for it, and later you can sell that claim to someone else who regards it as meaningful and important for, presumably, profit. That’s how NFT ownership works: anyone can copy-paste your house, but your name is on the deed, and the metaphorical hall of records can’t burn down or whatever because everyone has copies of the records on a peer-to-peer network they can access via their home computer, which is next to their erotic poster of Sailor Moon.</p><p>Perhaps that generalization is unfair. And yet there is something about the aesthetics of NFTs — not a sameness, exactly, but a particular deficiency of which they all partake, such that even though they look different, they all manage to suck in the same way. It’s tempting to say they suck the way everything sucks now, but it’s more like how one particular strain of American aesthetics has sucked for the last 20 years. NFTs are the human capacity for visual expression as understood by the guy at the vape store. There is the predominance of skulls. There is the melodramatic deployment of the <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/0x1dc5d3b2162f9500d7ddec14eb0ba9ccb43bc20c/3507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">visual language of video games</a>, as if romanticism had been invented by people who never went outside. There are the twin adolescent themes of aggression and boredom, as in the <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bored-ape-nft-sells-for-3000-instead-of-300000-due-to-typo-093836525.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIbkJHOqsZBFM7A24_ukwg9RuVcRoCZjcY0_7m1rMLFIpPR6aG-AtOx0l1DmbvKakEQgJtGLdtEQDoKb355lfIZoyK0QI1vsEo9JB5d-yFIgidEQ8_-1f0mTeaWFp37i5jaCGzoq3rH0tkRdbvJtQvD416wp6dy99fDurTcJIyHA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bored Ape series of NFTs</a>, some of which are now valued at over $300,000 and all of which depict chimpanzees in human clothes looking, well, bored.</p><p>All of the Bored Apes are clearly produced from the same template: a three-quarters profile of a chimp with the same nose, the same head shape, and the same ears, variously embellished by different combinations of accessories: earrings, open mouth, stubble, laser eyes.
