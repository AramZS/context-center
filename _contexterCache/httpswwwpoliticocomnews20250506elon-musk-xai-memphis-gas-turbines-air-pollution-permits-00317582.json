nitrogen oxides, according to calculations by environmental groups whose data has been reviewed by POLITICO’s E&E News.

That’s according to calculations by the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonpartisan legal advocacy group that focuses on the South, which used turbine manufacturer spec sheets to estimate xAI’s annual emissions and compare them with pollution that other South Memphis plants have reported to the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory.\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    The turbines were necessary to get the third version of the company’s AI chatbot up and running in time, Musk said at the product’s launch in February, adding: “We have generators on one side of the building, just trailer after trailer of generators until we can get the utility power to come in.” He has not publicly addressed the pollution concerns and did not respond to requests for comment about the turbines powering the plant and their lack of pollution controls.\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    Just three miles away is Boxtown, a secluded neighborhood that officially became part of the city of Memphis in 1968, the year that the Rev.

Before EPA said it would fire or reassign some 450 employees working on environmental justice initiatives late last month, the agency listed making “the United States the artificial intelligence capital of the world” among five agency priorities “that will guide EPA’s work.” EPA has also issued new guidance easing pollution rules for some internal combustion engines commonly used by data centers.\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n        \n    \n\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    “Data centers are a highly competitive space, and other companies are watching what xAI does,” said Amanda Garcia, senior attorney for the SELC, which has advocated for data centers to use more renewable energy to reduce their pollution and draw from the grid. ”Right now, what xAI is doing is essentially running a power plant without a permit, and it has a real risk of harming people’s health.”\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    XAI’s main product is Musk’s chatbot, Grok, which also generates images.

Many have health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that predate xAI’s arrival in South Memphis. But NOx emissions are known to worsen lung conditions, and residents fear that the sheer volume released by xAI will further harm their health.

They directed xAI to a former oven factory vacated just a couple of years prior that was already equipped with a gas hookup and a substation that could immediately supply 8 MW of power. During the meetings, the utility agreed to support xAI’s request for 150 MW, which would need approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority’s board of directors.\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n        \n    \n\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    “The AI race is just that, it’s a race,” Townsend said. “So expediting and building out infrastructure as quickly as possible in the most appropriate ways, within the lines of regulations and laws, that is how we have been instructed and guided.”\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    The Memphis utility declined to make its president, Doug McGowen, available for an interview or answer written questions about xAI’s power supply, referring all comment requests to the Chamber of Commerce.\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    Left out of those negotiations were the Memphis City Council; the county Board of Commissioners; and TVA, whose board ultimately had to approve any requests for more than 100 MW of power.\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    They only learned about the deal in early June, after the deal was done, when Musk announced it with a post on X referencing Memphis’ illustrious music history: “Elvis is in the building.”\n\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n    Almost immediately after becoming public, the deal sparked concerns about how xAI’s power use would affect Memphis residents.
