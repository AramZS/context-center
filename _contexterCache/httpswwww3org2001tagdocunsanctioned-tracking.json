This is very common on the Web; many sites that you browse will share what you do on them with several others — in some cases, dozens.</p>\n\n<p>Collectively, tracking technologies form the basis of common Web features like shopping carts, persistent site preferences, and behavioral advertising, which allows many Web sites to fund themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Some tracking mechanisms are defined by Web standards, and their design takes into account user needs for privacy and control over data flows. One of the best-known and most widespread is  cookies [<cite><a class=\"bibref\" href=\"#bib-RFC6265\">RFC6265</a></cite>]. More recently, other mechanisms such as [<cite><a class=\"bibref\" href=\"#bib-webstorage\">webstorage</a></cite>] have been standardized to complement cookies.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, browsers provide explicit ways for you to limit when standards-defined tracking technologies are used, either directly or with extensions. For example, a privacy-conscious user can choose to use a cookie blocker, or manually delete cookies. As such, the standards-defined tracking technologies are effectively “opt out” — while they are on by default, you remain in control of them, as long as you accept that sites may not work as well (or at all) if you don't allow their use.</p>\n\n<p>Standards-defined tracking mechanisms also have the benefit of transparency. Users can inspect cookies and other locally stored data and user agents can provide some notice to the user that data is stored by this site. Tools have been developed that enable those users specifically interested in awareness of the tracking of their online activity to document and visualize the use of cookies and tracking pixels; for example, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/\">Lightbeam</a>.</p> \n\n<p>In practice, many end users do not themselves understand the details of the local storage mechanisms and their use for tracking. However, tracking based upon standards allows researchers, advocates and regulators to leverage their visibility and use tools to identify and evaluate the privacy-sensitive behavior of online tracking. This work is important input to making tools that can help users manage their privacy appropriately.</p>\n\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control\" typeof=\"bibo:Chapter\" resource=\"#unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control\" property=\"bibo:hasPart\">\n<!--OddPage--><h2 id=\"h-unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control\" resource=\"#h-unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control\"><span property=\"xhv:role\" resource=\"xhv:heading\"><span class=\"secno\">2. </span>Unsanctioned Tracking: Tracking without User Control</span></h2>\n\n<p>However, sites also track user activity outside of these well-defined mechanisms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Browser fingerprinting</strong> uses small variations in your Web browser implementation and configuration — as well as that of your computer itself — to uniquely identify it and correlate it with your activity.</li>\n\n  <li>So-called <strong>SuperCookies</strong> use implementation bugs, browser fingerprinting and other techniques to continue to identify you and correlate your activity even after you clear your cookies (e.g. “re-synchronizing” them).</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Header enrichment</strong> is performed by some network operators who add HTTP request headers that reveal their customers' identities to the Web sites they visit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlike standards-defined tracking, the operation of these unsanctioned techniques is not defined by Web standards, is not user-visible, and it is not under user control.

Users expect that their browsing information will be kept relatively private. This trust, and users controlling their experience, is a fundamental part of how the Web works.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance of this information in monetary terms, the World Economic Forum has <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/reports/personal-data-emergence-new-asset-class\">classified personal data as “a new asset class”</a> — with the implication that if you are unable to control your data, you are on the losing side of a forced transaction.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, tracking users' activity without their consent or knowledge is also a blatant violation of the human right to privacy [<cite><a class=\"bibref\" href=\"#bib-udhr\">udhr</a></cite>].</p>\n\n<p>As a result, a growing body of legal, social and technical constraints have developed around the use of standards-based tracking technology on the Web. Because they are well-defined, it is possible to discuss and regulate their use, as well as build tools to understand, visualize and control them.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"http://eucookiedirective.com/\">EU Cookie Directive</a> regulates the use of cookies in that jurisdiction; browsers have cookie control interfaces and extensions; and researchers can plot how cookies are used on the Web.</p>\n\n<p>Unsanctioned tracking, on the other hand, has little such affordance; it is difficult (and sometimes, impossible) to detect using purely technical means in the browser. It stems not from a well-defined specification, but instead from exploitation of certain aspects of how the Web works.</p>\n\n<p>The aggregate effect of unsanctioned tracking is to undermine user trust in the Web itself. Moreover, if browsers cannot isolate activity between sites and offer users control over their data, they are unable to act as trusted agents for the user.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, unsanctioned tracking can be harmful even if non-identifying data is shared, because it provides the linkage among disparate information streams across contextual boundaries. For example the sharing of an opaque fingerprint among a set of unrelated online purchases can provide enough information to enable advertisers to determine that user of that browser is pregnant — and hence to target her with pregnancy-specific advertisements even before she has disclosed her pregnancy.</p>\n\n</section>\n<section id=\"limitations-of-technical-solutions\" typeof=\"bibo:Chapter\" resource=\"#limitations-of-technical-solutions\" property=\"bibo:hasPart\">\n<!--OddPage--><h2 id=\"h-limitations-of-technical-solutions\" resource=\"#h-limitations-of-technical-solutions\"><span property=\"xhv:role\" resource=\"xhv:heading\"><span class=\"secno\">4. </span>Limitations of Technical Solutions</span></h2>\n\n<p>We have had numerous discussions throughout the Web community about limiting the the browser fingerprinting “surface area” that a browser exposes, by reducing the variability in how browsers behave.

Unsanctioned Tracking: Tracking without User Control\n\nHowever, sites also track user activity outside of these well-defined mechanisms:\n\n\n  Browser fingerprinting uses small variations in your Web browser implementation and configuration — as well as that of your computer itself — to uniquely identify it and correlate it with your activity.\n\n  So-called SuperCookies use implementation bugs, browser fingerprinting and other techniques to continue to identify you and correlate your activity even after you clear your cookies (e.g. “re-synchronizing” them).\n\n  Header enrichment is performed by some network operators who add HTTP request headers that reveal their customers' identities to the Web sites they visit.\n\n\nUnlike standards-defined tracking, the operation of these unsanctioned techniques is not defined by Web standards, is not user-visible, and it is not under user control. If you use the same browser to visit two different sites, it is technically possible for the sites to identify your browser and correlate your behavior between them (and any other site that they work with). While there are a few legitimate uses of such methods (e.g., combatting Denial of Service attacks, or providing greater certainty about user identity for sites such as banks), unsanctioned tracking is often used for purposes that many consider malicious.\n\nThere is ample evidence that many sites already use such unsanctioned tracking methods. For more information, see resources like Panopticlick, Evercookie, and FPDetective.\n\n\n\n3. Why Unsanctioned Tracking is Harmful\n\nStaying in control of personal data is important to many people, because data about a person — in particular their activity on the Web — can be used to understand how they think, work and live.  Users expect that their browsing information will be kept relatively private. This trust, and users controlling their experience, is a fundamental part of how the Web works.\n\nRecognizing the importance of this information in monetary terms, the World Economic Forum has classified personal data as “a new asset class” — with the implication that if you are unable to control your data, you are on the losing side of a forced transaction.\n\nFurthermore, tracking users' activity without their consent or knowledge is also a blatant violation of the human right to privacy [udhr].\n\nAs a result, a growing body of legal, social and technical constraints have developed around the use of standards-based tracking technology on the Web. Because they are well-defined, it is possible to discuss and regulate their use, as well as build tools to understand, visualize and control them.\n\nFor example, the EU Cookie Directive regulates the use of cookies in that jurisdiction; browsers have cookie control interfaces and extensions; and researchers can plot how cookies are used on the Web.\n\nUnsanctioned tracking, on the other hand, has little such affordance; it is difficult (and sometimes, impossible) to detect using purely technical means in the browser. It stems not from a well-defined specification, but instead from exploitation of certain aspects of how the Web works.\n\nThe aggregate effect of unsanctioned tracking is to undermine user trust in the Web itself. Moreover, if browsers cannot isolate activity between sites and offer users control over their data, they are unable to act as trusted agents for the user.\n\nNotably, unsanctioned tracking can be harmful even if non-identifying data is shared, because it provides the linkage among disparate information streams across contextual boundaries. For example the sharing of an opaque fingerprint among a set of unrelated online purchases can provide enough information to enable advertisers to determine that user of that browser is pregnant — and hence to target her with pregnancy-specific advertisements even before she has disclosed her pregnancy.\n\n\n\n4. Limitations of Technical Solutions\n\nWe have had numerous discussions throughout the Web community about limiting the the browser fingerprinting “surface area” that a browser exposes, by reducing the variability in how browsers behave.  In those discussions, we have tried to consider the full span of characteristics about a user, their browser and their activities that may be tracked.\n\nWhile reducing fingerprinting surface area may mitigate some kinds of unsanctioned tracking, it is inadequate to foil a determined adversary. The variety of documented techniques for browser fingerprinting, from enumerating the extensions installed in the browser to examining exactly how fonts are displayed on screens, continues to increase as new features are developed.\n\nAs an extreme example, it has now been shown possible [spy-sandbox] to “listen” to the CPU on a computer to detect mouse, network and other activity, using only some JavaScript in a Web page. This information can then be used in the machine fingerprint.\n\nIn this environment, it is impractical for specification design to eliminate fingerprinting; not only would such restriction severely hobble the capability of the Web, it would also break a substantial amount of existing content. Moreover, theory confirms that we cannot expect to eliminate these problems on a general-purpose system: From a theoretical perspective, eliminating browser fingerprinting is essentially the same problem as eliminating covert channels [confinement].\n\nAs a result, we cannot solve the issues that unsanctioned tracking raises through solely technical means. At times, they may be more appropriately addressed through policy (e.g., legislation and/or regulation).\n\n\n\n5. Findings\n\nTherefore, the TAG:\n\n\n\nFinds that unsanctioned tracking is actively harmful to the Web, because it is not under the control of users and not transparent.\n\nBelieves that, because combatting fingerprinting is difficult, new Web specifications should take reasonable measures to avoid adding unneeded fingerprinting surface area. However, added surface area should not be a primary factor in determining whether to add a new feature.\n\nAsserts that when a new feature does add fingerprinting surface area, it should be documented as such.\n\nFinds that new local storage features and other potential tracking mechanisms should maintain and interoperate with existing user controls.\n\nEncourages browser vendors to expose appropriate controls to users who wish to minimize their fingerprinting surface area.\n\nAcknowledges that despite best efforts, technical solutions to unsanctioned tracking are not able to completely prevent its use by a determined adversary. Instead, our focus should be on making sure that unsanctioned tracking does not become “normal” on the Web.\n\nEncourages policy makers to be aware that unsanctioned tracking may introduce privacy, security and consumer protection concerns within their jurisdiction, and to consider appropriate action.\n\n\n\nThe TAG is happy to provide guidance to community members who need specific advice regarding fingerprinting in their specifications.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nA.
