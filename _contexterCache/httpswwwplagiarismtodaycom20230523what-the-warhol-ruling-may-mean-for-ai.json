Though the exact amount and direction of the change is yet to be determined, <a href=\"https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2023/05/18/how-the-warhol-ruling-could-change-fair-use/\">it is inevitable that this case will shift the way future fair use decisions are reached in lower courts</a>. </p><p>To that end, <a href=\"https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2023/01/17/the-wave-of-ai-lawsuits-have-begun/\">the biggest fair use question in front of the lower courts right now is the issue of generative AI</a>. Nearly every major player in the AI space is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit from one or more parties. This includes Stability AI, which is being sued by Getty Images and a pair of class action lawsuits that target GitHub, Midjourney and, once again, Stability AI.</p><p>However, those lawsuits have just begun and, as many have noted, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/in-generative-ai-legal-wild-west-lawsuits-are-just-getting-started.html\">we’re very much in the “wild west” days when it comes to AI and copyright</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, it’s worth asking what the Warhol ruling may mean for AI moving forward. The answer is simple: AI companies should be worried about the Warhol decision, as none of its implications bode well for them.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Brief Background</strong></h4><p>In 1981 photographer Lynn Goldsmith photographed the musician Prince. Three years later, she licensed one of those photos to Vanity Fair Magazine, who commissioned Andy Warhol to create a now-iconic painting of Prince for their cover.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2016, after the death of Prince, Vanity Fair then learned that Warhol had actually created a whole series of paintings based on the Goldsmith photograph. They then licensed one of those images, <em>Orange Prince</em>, from the Andy Warhol Foundation (AWF) for use on their commemorative cover.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Goldsmith claimed that <em>Orange Prince</em> (as well as the other paintings) were not licensed and were an infringement of her image. The AWF proactively sued Goldsmith, seeking a declaratory judgement of non-infringement.</p><p>The case ended up making it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Goldsmith. The court acknowledged that Warhol’s piece was transformative, but said that the piece competed directly with Goldsmith’s work and served as a replacement, citing the fact that Vanity Fair licensed the painting rather than Goldsmith’s original photo.</p><p>While seemingly a minor decision that follows the letter of fair use closely, it’s actually something of an upheaval in the way that fair use has been determined over the past few decades.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since 1994, the question of transformativeness has been the primary and often the sole topic discussed in fair use cases. This has led to some controversial rulings involving artists like Richard Prince and <a href=\"https://cpyrightvisualarts.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/jeff-koons-vs-andrea-blanch/\">Jeffrey Koons</a>.</p><p>The issue of transformativeness took center stage following the case Campbell v. Acruff-Rose Music, better known as the <em>Pretty Woman</em> case. There, the band 2 Live Crew successfully argued that their parody of the Roy Orbison song <em>Oh, Pretty Woman</em> was a fair use.</p><p>The Warhol ruling, however, pulls back on that. It makes it clear that, while transformativeness is an important question, it is not the sole factor and not even the sole element of the first factor.&nbsp;</p><p>That, in turn, is why AI companies should be paying attention to this decision. Because it may have upended much of their legal theory on why AI is a fair use.</p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why AI Should Be Worried</strong></h4><p>Generative AIs work by ingesting, or processing, large amounts of human-generated work and then training the model to create “new” work based upon that entered data.&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly all data that AIs have ingested, including text and image AIs, has been without permission from the original creators. This means that AIs are built on large volumes of copyright-protected material that they are using without permission. </p><p>However, AI companies have long argued that their use of that source material is allowed because it’s a fair use. Their argument for that, primarily, has been how transformative AI-generated works are.&nbsp;</p><p>Until last week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23444685/generative-ai-copyright-infringement-legal-fair-use-training-data\">that argument seemed pretty solid</a>, at least from a historical perspective.

Though the exact amount and direction of the change is yet to be determined, it is inevitable that this case will shift the way future fair use decisions are reached in lower courts.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTo that end, the biggest fair use question in front of the lower courts right now is the issue of generative AI. Nearly every major player in the AI space is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit from one or more parties. This includes Stability AI, which is being sued by Getty Images and a pair of class action lawsuits that target GitHub, Midjourney and, once again, Stability AI.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, those lawsuits have just begun and, as many have noted, we\\u2019re very much in the \\u201cwild west\\u201d days when it comes to AI and copyright.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nWith that in mind, it\\u2019s worth asking what the Warhol ruling may mean for AI moving forward. The answer is simple: AI companies should be worried about the Warhol decision, as none of its implications bode well for them.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Brief Background\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1981 photographer Lynn Goldsmith photographed the musician Prince. Three years later, she licensed one of those photos to Vanity Fair Magazine, who commissioned Andy Warhol to create a now-iconic painting of Prince for their cover.\\n\\n\\n\\nFast-forward to 2016, after the death of Prince, Vanity Fair then learned that Warhol had actually created a whole series of paintings based on the Goldsmith photograph. They then licensed one of those images, Orange Prince, from the Andy Warhol Foundation (AWF) for use on their commemorative cover.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, Goldsmith claimed that Orange Prince (as well as the other paintings) were not licensed and were an infringement of her image. The AWF proactively sued Goldsmith, seeking a declaratory judgement of non-infringement.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe case ended up making it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Goldsmith. The court acknowledged that Warhol\\u2019s piece was transformative, but said that the piece competed directly with Goldsmith\\u2019s work and served as a replacement, citing the fact that Vanity Fair licensed the painting rather than Goldsmith\\u2019s original photo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile seemingly a minor decision that follows the letter of fair use closely, it\\u2019s actually something of an upheaval in the way that fair use has been determined over the past few decades.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nEver since 1994, the question of transformativeness has been the primary and often the sole topic discussed in fair use cases. This has led to some controversial rulings involving artists like Richard Prince and Jeffrey Koons.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe issue of transformativeness took center stage following the case Campbell v. Acruff-Rose Music, better known as the Pretty Woman case. There, the band 2 Live Crew successfully argued that their parody of the Roy Orbison song Oh, Pretty Woman was a fair use.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Warhol ruling, however, pulls back on that. It makes it clear that, while transformativeness is an important question, it is not the sole factor and not even the sole element of the first factor.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nThat, in turn, is why AI companies should be paying attention to this decision. Because it may have upended much of their legal theory on why AI is a fair use.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy AI Should Be Worried\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerative AIs work by ingesting, or processing, large amounts of human-generated work and then training the model to create \\u201cnew\\u201d work based upon that entered data.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly all data that AIs have ingested, including text and image AIs, has been without permission from the original creators. This means that AIs are built on large volumes of copyright-protected material that they are using without permission.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, AI companies have long argued that their use of that source material is allowed because it\\u2019s a fair use. Their argument for that, primarily, has been how transformative AI-generated works are.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nUntil last week, that argument seemed pretty solid, at least from a historical perspective. Given how much weight transformative uses were given in fair use analyses, and how transformative AI works are (at least when they are producing \\u201coriginal\\u201d content), it seemed likely that the argument would succeed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Warhol ruling, to put it simply, changes that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy shifting the focus away from how transformative the use is, the Supreme Court devalued the best argument in favor of AI companies. Now, transformativeness must be contrasted with other elements, most notably how the new work competes with and\\/or replaces the original in the marketplace.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat, however, is not likely a discussion AI companies are eager to have. Stock photographers, for example, should have little trouble proving that the new works are used to compete with stock photos. Likewise, journalists should have no trouble showing how AI-generated text is used to replace news articles.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings get even worse when you realize AIs often are tasked with producing works that are \\u201cin the style of\\u201d a particular creator, making works that are designed to directly compete with that artist\\u2019s work.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nTo be clear, this doesn\\u2019t mean that those suing AI companies are a lock to win. The issue is still complicated, and the Supreme Court made it clear that tranformativeness is still very much a factor and AI companies still have arguments in their favor.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, the argument that AI companies have largely based their businesses around has been severely weakened, and that should give them pause.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat This Means Moving Forward\\n\\n\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a very good chance that the first major fair use cases after the Warhol ruling will involve AI.

ruling in the case between the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and photographer Lynn Goldsmith.&nbsp;</p><p>As we looked at then, the case represents a rare ruling by the Supreme Court on the issue of fair use. Though the exact amount and direction of the change is yet to be determined, <a href=\"https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2023/05/18/how-the-warhol-ruling-could-change-fair-use/\">it is inevitable that this case will shift the way future fair use decisions are reached in lower courts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, <a href=\"https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2023/01/17/the-wave-of-ai-lawsuits-have-begun/\">the biggest fair use question in front of the lower courts right now is the issue of generative AI</a>. Nearly every major player in the AI space is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit from one or more parties. This includes Stability AI, which is being sued by Getty Images and a pair of class action lawsuits that target GitHub, Midjourney and, once again, Stability AI.</p><p>However, those lawsuits have just begun and, as many have noted, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/in-generative-ai-legal-wild-west-lawsuits-are-just-getting-started.html\">we’re very much in the “wild west” days when it comes to AI and copyright</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, it’s worth asking what the Warhol ruling may mean for AI moving forward. The answer is simple: AI companies should be worried about the Warhol decision, as none of its implications bode well for them.</p><h4><strong>A Brief Background</strong></h4><p>In 1981 photographer Lynn Goldsmith photographed the musician Prince. Three years later, she licensed one of those photos to Vanity Fair Magazine, who commissioned Andy Warhol to create a now-iconic painting of Prince for their cover.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2016, after the death of Prince, Vanity Fair then learned that Warhol had actually created a whole series of paintings based on the Goldsmith photograph. They then licensed one of those images, <em>Orange Prince</em>, from the Andy Warhol Foundation (AWF) for use on their commemorative cover.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Goldsmith claimed that <em>Orange Prince</em> (as well as the other paintings) were not licensed and were an infringement of her image. The AWF proactively sued Goldsmith, seeking a declaratory judgement of non-infringement.</p><p>The case ended up making it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Goldsmith. The court acknowledged that Warhol’s piece was transformative, but said that the piece competed directly with Goldsmith’s work and served as a replacement, citing the fact that Vanity Fair licensed the painting rather than Goldsmith’s original photo.</p><p>While seemingly a minor decision that follows the letter of fair use closely, it’s actually something of an upheaval in the way that fair use has been determined over the past few decades.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since 1994, the question of transformativeness has been the primary and often the sole topic discussed in fair use cases. This has led to some controversial rulings involving artists like Richard Prince and <a href=\"https://cpyrightvisualarts.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/jeff-koons-vs-andrea-blanch/\">Jeffrey Koons</a>.</p><p>The issue of transformativeness took center stage following the case Campbell v.

Though the exact amount and direction of the change is yet to be determined, it is inevitable that this case will shift the way future fair use decisions are reached in lower courts. To that end, the biggest fair use question in front of the lower courts right now is the issue of generative AI. Nearly every major player in the AI space is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit from one or more parties. This includes Stability AI, which is being sued by Getty Images and a pair of class action lawsuits that target GitHub, Midjourney and, once again, Stability AI.However, those lawsuits have just begun and, as many have noted, we’re very much in the “wild west” days when it comes to AI and copyright. With that in mind, it’s worth asking what the Warhol ruling may mean for AI moving forward. The answer is simple: AI companies should be worried about the Warhol decision, as none of its implications bode well for them.A Brief BackgroundIn 1981 photographer Lynn Goldsmith photographed the musician Prince. Three years later, she licensed one of those photos to Vanity Fair Magazine, who commissioned Andy Warhol to create a now-iconic painting of Prince for their cover.Fast-forward to 2016, after the death of Prince, Vanity Fair then learned that Warhol had actually created a whole series of paintings based on the Goldsmith photograph. They then licensed one of those images, Orange Prince, from the Andy Warhol Foundation (AWF) for use on their commemorative cover. However, Goldsmith claimed that Orange Prince (as well as the other paintings) were not licensed and were an infringement of her image. The AWF proactively sued Goldsmith, seeking a declaratory judgement of non-infringement.The case ended up making it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Goldsmith. The court acknowledged that Warhol’s piece was transformative, but said that the piece competed directly with Goldsmith’s work and served as a replacement, citing the fact that Vanity Fair licensed the painting rather than Goldsmith’s original photo.While seemingly a minor decision that follows the letter of fair use closely, it’s actually something of an upheaval in the way that fair use has been determined over the past few decades. Ever since 1994, the question of transformativeness has been the primary and often the sole topic discussed in fair use cases. This has led to some controversial rulings involving artists like Richard Prince and Jeffrey Koons.The issue of transformativeness took center stage following the case Campbell v. Acruff-Rose Music, better known as the Pretty Woman case. There, the band 2 Live Crew successfully argued that their parody of the Roy Orbison song Oh, Pretty Woman was a fair use.The Warhol ruling, however, pulls back on that. It makes it clear that, while transformativeness is an important question, it is not the sole factor and not even the sole element of the first factor. That, in turn, is why AI companies should be paying attention to this decision. Because it may have upended much of their legal theory on why AI is a fair use.Why AI Should Be WorriedGenerative AIs work by ingesting, or processing, large amounts of human-generated work and then training the model to create “new” work based upon that entered data. Nearly all data that AIs have ingested, including text and image AIs, has been without permission from the original creators. This means that AIs are built on large volumes of copyright-protected material that they are using without permission. However, AI companies have long argued that their use of that source material is allowed because it’s a fair use. Their argument for that, primarily, has been how transformative AI-generated works are. Until last week, that argument seemed pretty solid, at least from a historical perspective. Given how much weight transformative uses were given in fair use analyses, and how transformative AI works are (at least when they are producing “original” content), it seemed likely that the argument would succeed.The Warhol ruling, to put it simply, changes that.By shifting the focus away from how transformative the use is, the Supreme Court devalued the best argument in favor of AI companies. Now, transformativeness must be contrasted with other elements, most notably how the new work competes with and/or replaces the original in the marketplace.That, however, is not likely a discussion AI companies are eager to have. Stock photographers, for example, should have little trouble proving that the new works are used to compete with stock photos. Likewise, journalists should have no trouble showing how AI-generated text is used to replace news articles.Things get even worse when you realize AIs often are tasked with producing works that are “in the style of” a particular creator, making works that are designed to directly compete with that artist’s work. To be clear, this doesn’t mean that those suing AI companies are a lock to win.
