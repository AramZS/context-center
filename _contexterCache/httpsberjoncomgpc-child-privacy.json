Note that these privacy rights can be understood broadly for instance to include excessive engagement drivers or unfair nudging methods.\nYou then turn on GPC by default for children, ideally using knowledge that sits at the OS or generally the user agent level thereby signally that the corresponding rights must be afforded. This creates a system in which children benefit from much broader privacy protections but are hidden in a wider group (of privacy-conscious adults) such that no one can tell that they are children.\nAs part of this arrangement, it is important that services must not use the GPC for other types of age gating (eg. porn, alcohol) as that would constitute a loss of service that would violate the rights of the adults in the set.\nThis approach is simple to specify and simple for businesses to implement, especially since it aligns with compliance requirements that many of them already operate under.\n      \n    \n        ","length":3955,"excerpt":"Improved privacy for children is sorely needed, but designing it so that it is broadly applicable and enforceable without either creating risk for children or encouraging businesses to find ways to not know that children are using their services is hard.
