whiskers would win the “full beard 30.1-45cm” category. But he encountered the wrong Austin: Drug Enforcement Agent Austin Love. While on a layover in Atlanta, the DEA intercepted Vallerius and searched his laptop, discovering $500,000 in cryptocurrencies, the super-private Tor communication program, and an encryption key connected with the name OxyMonster, an online pseudonym they had been following. The DEA promptly arrested Vallerius and charged him with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, including cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine, LSD, and oxycodone. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.\n </p>\n \n            <div class=\"jsx-4294058053 inline-newsletter\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 444 35.6\" class=\"jsx-4294058053\"><path d=\"M128.11 33c0-.28-.21-.4-.51-.4h-.46v1.37h.25v-.55h.17l.36.55h.27l-.38-.59a.37.37 0 0 0 .3-.38zm-.51.22h-.21v-.43h.21c.16 0 .25.06.25.21 0 .11-.09.18-.25.18zm0-1.25a1.3 1.3 0 0 0-1.3 1.32 1.3 1.3 0 1 0 1.3-1.32zm0 2.44a1.13 1.13 0 1 1 1.1-1.13 1.09 1.09 0 0 1-1.1 1.09zm-34.43 0h7l9.3-20.25 9.22 20.25h7L109.43.78zM50.23.6A17.18 17.18 0 0 0 32.84 18a17.39 17.39 0 1 0 34.78 0A17.18 17.18 0 0 0 50.23.6zm.23 28.85A11.32 11.32 0 0 1 39.34 18a11.13 11.13 0 1 1 22.25 0 11.33 11.33 0 0 1-11.13 11.45zM93 1.75L83.66 22 74.43 1.75h-7L83.66 35.3 99.91 1.75zM21.51 21.81L0 .93v33.33h6V14.75L27.58 35.6V1.78H21.5zM361.36 6.45h8v27h6v-27h8v-5h-22zm-25 0h8v27h6v-27h8v-5h-22zM435.15 20a18.8 18.8 0 0 0 2.46-1.78 8.82 8.82 0 0 0 1.67-2.26 10.53 10.53 0 0 0 .94-2.54 12.48 12.48 0 0 0 .29-2.64 9.87 9.87 0 0 0-.93-4.34A9.13 9.13 0 0 0 437 3.17a12.16 12.16 0 0 0-4.13-2 19.31 19.31 0 0 0-5.38-.7h-10.17v33h6v-12h5.06l7.31 12H444zm-1.7-7.28a4.65 4.65 0 0 1-1 1.77 5.48 5.48 0 0 1-1.82 1.4 6.34 6.34 0 0 1-2.88.58h-4.48v-11h4.52a6.56 6.56 0 0 1 2.93.57 5.33 5.33 0 0 1 1.8 1.42 4.87 4.87 0 0 1 .91 1.8 6.78 6.78 0 0 1 .26 1.71 6.54 6.54 0 0 1-.24 1.73zm-117.06 6.73h14v-5h-14v-9h16v-5h-22v33h23v-5h-17zm77.94 0h15v-5h-15v-9h17v-5h-22v33h23v-5h-18zm-152.39 2.8L234 1.45h-5.34l2.86 8.55L226 22.29l-7.2-20.84h-6.3l13.13 33.37 8.56-19L242 34.73l13.12-33.28h-5.8zm-48.46-2.8h15v-5h-15v-9h16v-5h-22v33h23v-5h-17zm-17.85 2.85L151.51 0v33.45h5l-.14-21.2s23.91 22.43 24.12 22.69V1.45h-5zM289.41 1.45h-5v32h22v-5h-17zm-14.64 15.19a19.38 19.38 0 0 0-3.92-1.87c-1.4-.48-2.71-1-3.92-1.43a13.18 13.18 0 0 1-3-1.58 2.72 2.72 0 0 1-1.2-2.29 3.13 3.13 0 0 1 1.61-2.68c3.21-2.11 8.28-.87 11.57.4l2-4.38a41.19 41.19 0 0 0-6.18-1.68 17.91 17.91 0 0 0-5.68-.13 11.11 11.11 0 0 0-6.81 3.49 7.72 7.72 0 0 0-1.67 7.28c1.9 5.77 9.24 6.06 13.69 8.78a4.53 4.53 0 0 1 2.12 2.31 3.5 3.5 0 0 1-1.2 3.54 7.25 7.25 0 0 1-3.62 1.47A16.36 16.36 0 0 1 258 26l-2.42 4.76a24 24 0 0 0 10.77 2.72c4.33 0 9.9-1.35 11.88-5.62A9 9 0 0 0 279 24a7.82 7.82 0 0 0-1.2-4.49 10.15 10.15 0 0 0-3.03-2.87z\" class=\"jsx-4294058053\"></path></svg><p class=\"jsx-4294058053 description\">Receive emails about upcoming NOVA programs and related content, as well as featured reporting about current events through a science lens.</p><form method=\"POST\" novalidate=\"\" action=\"//links.iterable.com/lists/addSubscriberForm?emailListId=362044\" class=\"jsx-4294058053\"><div class=\"jsx-4294058053 input-email\"><div class=\"jsx-2100503049 floatl\"><label for=\"email_address\" class=\"jsx-2100503049 floatl__label\">Email Address</label><input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Email Address\" id=\"email_address\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-required=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" class=\"jsx-2100503049 floatl__input\"/></div></div><div class=\"jsx-4294058053 input-zip-code\"><div class=\"jsx-2100503049 floatl\"><label for=\"zip_code\" class=\"jsx-2100503049 floatl__label\">Zip Code</label><input type=\"text\" name=\"zipOrPostal\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Zip Code\" id=\"zip_code\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-required=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" class=\"jsx-2100503049 floatl__input\"/></div></div><button type=\"submit\" class=\"jsx-4294058053 button formButton\">Subscribe</button></form></div><figure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"><img alt=\"gal-vallerius\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" height=\"451\" width=\"800\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/gal-vallerius.width-800.jpg\"/><figcaption>\n  Gal Vallerius, as seen in his Twitter profile circa 2014.\n <div class=\"credit\"></div></figcaption></figure>\n            \n <p>\n  Vallerius’s arrest was far from a random catch. For over a year, Love and other DEA agents had been investigating a dark web drug bazaar called Dream Market. In one key step, they noticed that an administrator of the site named OxyMonster was collecting Bitcoin donations through an online tip jar and that 15 of the 17 transactions moving Bitcoin out of the tip jar went to accounts belonging to a user named Vallerius on the site LocalBitcoins.\n </p>\n <div class=\"jsx-1913117677 inline-ad enhancement\"><div class=\"jsx-299375165 content\"><div id=\"long_article_inline\" class=\"jsx-299375165 ad-block\"><h6 class=\"jsx-299375165 title\">Support Provided By</h6><a href=\"https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/5000677869-online-sponsorship-support/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Learn more about our sponsors\" class=\"jsx-299375165\">Learn More</a><div tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" aria-describedby=\"describe-new-window-0\" title=\"3rd party content\" class=\"jsx-299375165\"><div style=\"width:300px;height:250px\"></div></div></div></div></div><p>\n  The agents searched for the uncommon name online and found several threads that seemed to connect the OxyMonster account to French national Gal Vallerius. For instance, OxyMonster often used the word “cheers,” double exclamation marks, and intermittent French in his posts; on Instagram and Twitter, Vallerius displayed the very same habits. The Bitcoin link provided enough evidence for a warrant for Vallerius’s arrest; soon after he set foot in the U.S. for the first time, he was nabbed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today, many people see cryptocurrencies as anonymous, untraceable digital money—and indeed, some of the first uses were to launder money and buy illegal drugs. But that reputation for privacy isn’t entirely warranted, as shown by the capture of Gal Vallerius. Rather than shield our identities, cryptocurrencies can function as sponges for information and could, perversely, further endanger our online privacy.\n </p>\n <div class=\"cove-box flex-video \" data-cove-id=\"3009128191\" data-cove-params=\"&amp;topbar=false\">\n </div>\n <div class=\"inline-caption\">\n  Bitcoin and other cryoptocurrencies—the future of money or hype? Here&#x27;s what they are.\n </div>\n <p>\n  We already see some of the creepy potential of online tracking, like when we are presented with ads on a website that clearly relate to Google searches we did previously. Digital currencies could dramatically raise the stakes. If we start broadly using them and our purchase histories leak through accidents or hacks, much of our private lives could be exposed: all the books and movies we enjoy; all the medication and treatments we are prescribed; all the birth control, prophylactics, and intimate products we discreetly order.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even many digital-money proponents say the lack of privacy is a major problem. “If we were to go to a Bitcoin world now, it would be a net negative,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell computer scientist and outspoken fan of cryptocurrency. “I can’t imagine doing that now. That would be crazy.”\n </p>\n <div class=\"jsx-73791332 related\"><h2 class=\"jsx-73791332\">Related</h2><a class=\"jsx-1990757357 link-reset\" href=\"/wgbh/nova/article/twin-towers-survivor-story/\"><figure class=\"jsx-1990757357\"><img src=\"/wgbh/nova/_next/static/images/default-c37189b91668ca6115ce7b0ae4ecef13.png\" class=\"jsx-1990757357\"/></figure><div class=\"jsx-1990757357 info\"><h3 class=\"jsx-1990757357\">A Twin Towers&#x27; Survivor Story</h3></div></a><a class=\"jsx-1990757357 link-reset\" href=\"/wgbh/nova/article/saving-venice/\"><figure class=\"jsx-1990757357\"><img src=\"/wgbh/nova/_next/static/images/default-c37189b91668ca6115ce7b0ae4ecef13.png\" class=\"jsx-1990757357\"/></figure><div class=\"jsx-1990757357 info\"><h3 class=\"jsx-1990757357\">Saving Venice From the Sea</h3></div></a><a class=\"jsx-1990757357 link-reset\" href=\"/wgbh/nova/article/stable-isotopes/\"><figure class=\"jsx-1990757357\"><img src=\"/wgbh/nova/_next/static/images/default-c37189b91668ca6115ce7b0ae4ecef13.png\" class=\"jsx-1990757357\"/></figure><div class=\"jsx-1990757357 info\"><h3 class=\"jsx-1990757357\">Stable Isotopes in Forensics</h3></div></a></div><p>\n  Yet some hopeful programmers are working on various tools to turn cryptocurrencies into safeguards of our information. With virtual money edging ever closer to mainstream adoption, the design choices made now may determine whether it ends up being mostly a means for illicit activities, a tool for free interaction, or simply a more efficient way for us to be watched.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Leaky Chains\n </h2>\n <p>\n  At their heart, cryptocurrencies are digital stores of value that are exist entirely as code. They’re built upon a technology known as blockchain that works as a decentralized ledger: instead of a list of transactions stored in a central hub like a bank or exchange, they’re distributed to a network of computer nodes that each keep a record of all transactions for each currency.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The great challenge to using a decentralized system like this is ensuring that each bit of digital money exists in one place at a time—like hard cash rather than easily duplicated software—and that all the nodes agree on who owns what. A solution to this problem was revealed in 2008, when the mysterious author (or authors) known as Satoshi Nakamoto published a technical paper outlining the design for Bitcoin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The paper included an ingenious plan for how nodes could come to a consensus about ownership of virtual currency: users who want to make transactions announce them to the network of computers running the Bitcoin software. Then computers called “miners” race to record new transactions in a block of information by solving a problem that mathematically ties the transactions together. Each block also connects in a specific way to earlier ones, forming a chain of blocks. Once a miner hits on the solution, it transmits it out to the network and all the nodes add it to their copies of the ledger. The miner is rewarded with Bitcoins. Each new block confirms the transactions in the existing chain, preventing the chain from being altered or hacked.\n </p>\n \n            <figure class=\"richtext-image full-width\">\n            <img src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/bitcoin-mining-farm.width-800.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoin-mining-farm\"/>\n            <figcaption>\n  A Bitcoin mining farm inside a warehouse.\n <div class=\"credit\"></div></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            \n <p>\n  A central feature of the peer-to-peer blockchain, and a key distinction from traditional centralized money, is that everyone can see every transaction. Of course, the users aren’t identified by their names or social security numbers or other personal information—only by an address made of a jumble of letters and numbers. At first glance, it seems like this achieves what Nakamoto was trying to accomplish: currency without a government, transactions without a bank, and openness without surveillance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But as more data piled up on the Bitcoin blockchain, it became clear that even if a single transaction is anonymous, multiple transactions might not be. By connecting scraps of information from many transactions on a public blockchain, observers can find out a surprising amount about what they represent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In 2013, back in cryptocurrency’s ancient past, UCSD researcher Sarah Meiklejohn and her colleagues inserted themselves into the Bitcoin blockchain by making a series of 344 transactions: they gambled, joined mining pools, and bought a range of goods, from cupcakes to a used CD from the band Boston to a Guy Fawkes mask (a reference to the hacker group Anonymous, which uses the mask as a logo of sorts). The activities revealed public Bitcoin addresses for the counterparties, which included many hubs of the Bitcoin economy, such as major exchanges. The researchers could then follow and study the flow of Bitcoins through the network. They could, for instance, easily trace some of the many Bitcoins that have been stolen from individuals and exchanges. Often they could tell when coins were changing ownership or merely moving between different accounts belonging to the same user, though some of the stolen coins took complicated paths that made it difficult to follow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With all of this data visible to anyone looking, a number of companies have sprung up offering sophisticated ways of analyzing blockchain data. And agencies like the FBI now routinely analyze information gleaned from blockchains to investigate ransom demands from hackers and other suspects—including alleged dark web drug kingpins headed to beard competitions.\n </p>\n \n            <figure class=\"richtext-image full-width\">\n            <img src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/bitcoin-accepted-here.width-800.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe accepting Bitcoins and housing Bitcoin ATM\"/>\n            <figcaption>\n  Though individual Bitcoin transactions can be anonymous, information about users can leak out of the system through other ways.\n <div class=\"credit\"></div></figcaption>\n            </figure>\n            \n <p>\n  There are also big risks to the privacy of regular, non-criminal users of cryptocurrencies, according to a study published by researchers at Princeton last summer. They found that big gobs of information are dripping out from blockchains through one of the internet’s great privacy holes: cookies and web trackers. These bits of code track people online to make websites more convenient to use and to target advertising around the web. The study showed that shopping websites often show web trackers the details of transactions, which can then be paired with other data, sometimes including the user’s address, email, and name. For people paying in virtual money, their crypto histories, including past purchases, could then be available to the many companies using trackers—and to any hacker who gains access to that data or who sneaks a malicious tracker onto a shopping site.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Privacy Protections\n </h2>\n <p>\n  But many of the biggest supporters of virtual money have been hard at work trying to fix cryptocurrencies’ privacy shortcomings. The simplest solution is simply to remove blockchains from public view. Some financial firms have done this by segregating projects from established blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the network that hosts the second-biggest cryptocurrency. The firms themselves run these walled gardens and give certain people permission to access them. This provides privacy and much greater efficiency but is fundamentally unsuitable for a cryptocurrency open for anyone to use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A number of “tumbler” services make traceable cryptocurrencies more private by mixing many piles of money from different accounts. This obscures where each bit of digital money goes and who owns it. Though mixing makes coins harder to trace, it leaves some questions about whether there are enough mixing partners, whether deposits to and withdrawals from the pool are truly obscured, whether putting your money into a tumbler connects it with money being laundered, or even whether tumbling is itself an indication of money laundering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some developers are taking the more extreme step of creating entirely new, privacy-oriented currencies. One of the most prominent, Monero, uses three approaches to obscuring what’s happening on its blockchain. When someone sends a payment, it’s identified with a “ring signature” that includes cryptographic keys from multiple users, camouflaging the true sender. Similarly, the recipient of a payment is hidden, since each payment goes to “stealth address.” And RingCT, or ring confidential transactions, which Monero instituted in early 2017, cloak even the amount of money being transferred.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Zero Knowledge Transactions\n </h2>\n <p>\n  More recently, there has emerged a new currency that boasts a more sophisticated privacy safeguard. Zcash allows users to securely encrypt all their transaction information so that it’s completely unreadable. That itself is an easy task; computer scientists have many clever ways of keeping information private, such as the public key encryption employed in secure web-browsing and email systems.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The trick, then, is verifying the data: if no one can see the details on the blockchain, how can you confirm that they’re correct? To do this, Zcash employs a new and frankly mind-boggling freak of math called a zk-SNARK. (The goofy-sounding name is an acronym for “zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge”—and aren’t you glad you asked.) The zk-SNARK is a special kind of proof that establishes the truth of a mathematical argument without revealing anything about what’s being proven. When a user makes a private Zcash transaction, it comes with a mathematically airtight assurance that it’s legitimate—that one account passed money to another and that it had enough Zcash to do so. Then a miner can look at the transaction, validate its proof, and record it in the blockchain for the world to see. Everyone can trust that the transaction is above board, even though no one knows the specifics of what happened. (The math is incredibly complex—well beyond the scope of this article. If you want more information, the Zcash site has\n  <a href=\"https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks.html\">\n   a more in-depth overview\n  </a>\n  and the Ethereum blog\n  <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/\">\n   dives into the details\n  </a>\n  .)\n </p>\n <aside class=\"pulledquote\">\n  Zcash developers went to what, under other circumstances, would seem like pathological lengths.\n </aside>\n <p>\n  Before integrating zk-SNARKS into the Zcash protocol, developers had to generate numbers called parameters that computers in the network would use to create and validate the proofs. But the process of creating parameters for public use also births an evil twin: a private counterpart that an unscrupulous person could use to secretly generate, out of the blue, a limitless amount of Zcash. (This wouldn’t compromise anyone else’s privacy or affect their accounts, but it could crash the value of the currency.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  To prevent anyone from monitoring the calculations and finding the private key—they refer to it as “toxic waste”—Zcash developers went to what, under other circumstances, would seem like pathological lengths. The parameters were generated in what developers called a “ceremony” in which six participants around the globe worked together in a carefully choreographed sequence. One person would do calculations on a computer not connected to the internet, burn the result to a DVD, walk the DVD over to a networked computer (crossing an unhackable “air gap”), securely send the data to another participant, who would burn it to another DVD, bring that to their airgapped computer for more calculations, and so on, for 27 tense yet boring hours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To further decrease the possibility of spying, the participants wrote their own software, bought all new computers from random stores, set up their computing stations in obscure motel rooms, physically removed all the communication hardware from the airgapped computers, and recorded every step of the process on video. One participant ran his calculations in a car driving across British Columbia, on a laptop held in a cardboard box lined with aluminum foil. After the ceremony, they erased all traces of the data through high-tech means like destroying the computer components with a grinder or blowtorch. If someone wanted to gain the power to generate Zcash at will, they would have to get the private “shard” from each participant and combine them to form the private key.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zcash and Monero don’t just diverge in their technical approaches—their family trees are very different, too. Monero is a freewheeling affair run by a community of unpaid enthusiasts with a libertarian-anarchist vibe. Like Bitcoin, a significant amount of the early interest came from drug dealers and other users of the dark web looking to hide from the law. Zcash, in contrast, was launched by a company, with significant outside investment. For the first four years of the currency’s existence, 20% of the mined coins will go to the founders, investors, and a non-profit that looks after the protocol. (With Zcash’s current price at $481, that reward would have a total value of over $700 million.) Zcash hasn’t made as much headway in retail applications as Monero over its short life, but it has a technology partnership with JPMorgan, and they recently worked together to launch a zero-knowledge security option for a blockchain product offered by the bank. (The financial industry is interested in private blockchains because firms need to be able to trade secretly so competitors can’t horn in on their positions.) The two currencies have developed a rivalry, with each side trumpeting its own strengths and sniping criticisms at the other.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Between Two Currencies\n </h2>\n <p>\n  In truth, each of these leading privacy-oriented currencies has its own strengths and weaknesses. In April, two different research groups announced that they’d found significant problems in how Monero hid user information, which could let careful observers identify the accounts involved in many transactions, though not the identities of the people behind them. (The issues were mainly present in the currency before RingCT was released last year but persisted in milder forms even after that.) There were ways that careful users could avoid revealing their information, but people in general are notoriously bad at taking active steps to preserve their privacy. Like tumblers, Monero depends on exacting sequences of steps, and with all the information available on a public blockchain, there could be small leaks that reveal people’s information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zcash has an advantage in that privacy is baked right into the protocol, so users and computers running the software don’t need to take any action to hide their tracks. But the possibility of someone accessing the private key still casts a faint shadow of doubt over the currency, even after it’s been accepted by many users and has a cumulative market value of over $1 billion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peter Todd, the ceremony participant who did his calculations from the mobile compute station driving across Canada, says the security measures were not as ironclad as they appeared. For instance, he points out that if the software for creating the parameters was compromised and made to generate “random” numbers that were not so random, a hacker might be able to recreate the private key and mint their own Zcash. Moreover, he says that even if the ceremony was safe, the high-powered math behind Zcash might not be. “zk-SNARKs are a very sophisticated mathematical technique, but you’ve got to remember how novel this math is,” he\n  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/go/finance/jp-morgan-bitcoin-zcash-wilcox/\">\n   told\n   <em>\n    Fortune\n   </em>\n   magazine\n  </a>\n  . “It would not surprise me and many other cryptographers if, in the future, that math got broken, making the entire system no longer secure.”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many of the developers working on the two currencies acknowledge these shortcomings and are working hard on fixes. Monero, for example, plans to continue to refine its dummy transactions so as to better hide the real ones. Zcash is planning a major upgrade to its code that will include a second ceremony, in which hundreds or even thousands of people will participate. For the currency to be safe from a would-be private-key villain, they’ll need just one of them to successfully destroy their private shard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At this point, it’s hard to predict whether these developers will succeed in providing secure, powerful ways for regular internet users to exchange value online. But money, brainpower, and optimism are all in abundant supply. These are hopeful days for cryptocurrencies.\n </p>\n</section>\n\n  \n\n  \n      <p>\n Photo credits: Gal Vallerius/Wayback Machine, Axel Castillo/pxhere,\n <a

But he encountered the wrong Austin: Drug Enforcement Agent Austin Love. While on a layover in Atlanta, the DEA intercepted Vallerius and searched his laptop, discovering $500,000 in cryptocurrencies, the super-private Tor communication program, and an encryption key connected with the name OxyMonster, an online pseudonym they had been following. The DEA promptly arrested Vallerius and charged him with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, including cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine, LSD, and oxycodone. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"gal-vallerius\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"451\\\" width=\\\"800\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/gal-vallerius.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003e\\n  Gal Vallerius, as seen in his Twitter profile circa 2014.\\n \\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Vallerius’s arrest was far from a random catch. For over a year, Love and other DEA agents had been investigating a dark web drug bazaar called Dream Market. In one key step, they noticed that an administrator of the site named OxyMonster was collecting Bitcoin donations through an online tip jar and that 15 of the 17 transactions moving Bitcoin out of the tip jar went to accounts belonging to a user named Vallerius on the site LocalBitcoins.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  The agents searched for the uncommon name online and found several threads that seemed to connect the OxyMonster account to French national Gal Vallerius. For instance, OxyMonster often used the word “cheers,” double exclamation marks, and intermittent French in his posts; on Instagram and Twitter, Vallerius displayed the very same habits. The Bitcoin link provided enough evidence for a warrant for Vallerius’s arrest; soon after he set foot in the U.S. for the first time, he was nabbed.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Today, many people see cryptocurrencies as anonymous, untraceable digital money—and indeed, some of the first uses were to launder money and buy illegal drugs. But that reputation for privacy isn’t entirely warranted, as shown by the capture of Gal Vallerius. Rather than shield our identities, cryptocurrencies can function as sponges for information and could, perversely, further endanger our online privacy.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cdiv class=\\\"cove-box flex-video \\\" data-cove-id=\\\"3009128191\\\" data-cove-params=\\\"\\u0026amp;topbar=false\\\"\\u003e\\n \\u003c/div\\u003e\\n \\u003cdiv class=\\\"inline-caption\\\"\\u003e\\n  Bitcoin and other cryoptocurrencies—the future of money or hype? Here's what they are.\\n \\u003c/div\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  We already see some of the creepy potential of online tracking, like when we are presented with ads on a website that clearly relate to Google searches we did previously. Digital currencies could dramatically raise the stakes. If we start broadly using them and our purchase histories leak through accidents or hacks, much of our private lives could be exposed: all the books and movies we enjoy; all the medication and treatments we are prescribed; all the birth control, prophylactics, and intimate products we discreetly order.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Even many digital-money proponents say the lack of privacy is a major problem. “If we were to go to a Bitcoin world now, it would be a net negative,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell computer scientist and outspoken fan of cryptocurrency. “I can’t imagine doing that now. That would be crazy.”\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Yet some hopeful programmers are working on various tools to turn cryptocurrencies into safeguards of our information. With virtual money edging ever closer to mainstream adoption, the design choices made now may determine whether it ends up being mostly a means for illicit activities, a tool for free interaction, or simply a more efficient way for us to be watched.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003ch2\\u003e\\n  Leaky Chains\\n \\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  At their heart, cryptocurrencies are digital stores of value that are exist entirely as code. They’re built upon a technology known as blockchain that works as a decentralized ledger: instead of a list of transactions stored in a central hub like a bank or exchange, they’re distributed to a network of computer nodes that each keep a record of all transactions for each currency.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  The great challenge to using a decentralized system like this is ensuring that each bit of digital money exists in one place at a time—like hard cash rather than easily duplicated software—and that all the nodes agree on who owns what. A solution to this problem was revealed in 2008, when the mysterious author (or authors) known as Satoshi Nakamoto published a technical paper outlining the design for Bitcoin.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  The paper included an ingenious plan for how nodes could come to a consensus about ownership of virtual currency: users who want to make transactions announce them to the network of computers running the Bitcoin software. Then computers called “miners” race to record new transactions in a block of information by solving a problem that mathematically ties the transactions together. Each block also connects in a specific way to earlier ones, forming a chain of blocks. Once a miner hits on the solution, it transmits it out to the network and all the nodes add it to their copies of the ledger. The miner is rewarded with Bitcoins. Each new block confirms the transactions in the existing chain, preventing the chain from being altered or hacked.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"bitcoin-mining-farm\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" width=\\\"800\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/bitcoin-mining-farm.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003e\\n  A Bitcoin mining farm inside a warehouse.\\n \\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  A central feature of the peer-to-peer blockchain, and a key distinction from traditional centralized money, is that everyone can see every transaction. Of course, the users aren’t identified by their names or social security numbers or other personal information—only by an address made of a jumble of letters and numbers. At first glance, it seems like this achieves what Nakamoto was trying to accomplish: currency without a government, transactions without a bank, and openness without surveillance.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  But as more data piled up on the Bitcoin blockchain, it became clear that even if a single transaction is anonymous, multiple transactions might not be. By connecting scraps of information from many transactions on a public blockchain, observers can find out a surprising amount about what they represent.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  In 2013, back in cryptocurrency’s ancient past, UCSD researcher Sarah Meiklejohn and her colleagues inserted themselves into the Bitcoin blockchain by making a series of 344 transactions: they gambled, joined mining pools, and bought a range of goods, from cupcakes to a used CD from the band Boston to a Guy Fawkes mask (a reference to the hacker group Anonymous, which uses the mask as a logo of sorts). The activities revealed public Bitcoin addresses for the counterparties, which included many hubs of the Bitcoin economy, such as major exchanges. The researchers could then follow and study the flow of Bitcoins through the network. They could, for instance, easily trace some of the many Bitcoins that have been stolen from individuals and exchanges. Often they could tell when coins were changing ownership or merely moving between different accounts belonging to the same user, though some of the stolen coins took complicated paths that made it difficult to follow.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  With all of this data visible to anyone looking, a number of companies have sprung up offering sophisticated ways of analyzing blockchain data. And agencies like the FBI now routinely analyze information gleaned from blockchains to investigate ransom demands from hackers and other suspects—including alleged dark web drug kingpins headed to beard competitions.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"Cafe accepting Bitcoins and housing Bitcoin ATM\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" width=\\\"800\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/bitcoin-accepted-here.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003e\\n  Though individual Bitcoin transactions can be anonymous, information about users can leak out of the system through other ways.\\n \\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  There are also big risks to the privacy of regular, non-criminal users of cryptocurrencies, according to a study published by researchers at Princeton last summer. They found that big gobs of information are dripping out from blockchains through one of the internet’s great privacy holes: cookies and web trackers. These bits of code track people online to make websites more convenient to use and to target advertising around the web. The study showed that shopping websites often show web trackers the details of transactions, which can then be paired with other data, sometimes including the user’s address, email, and name. For people paying in virtual money, their crypto histories, including past purchases, could then be available to the many companies using trackers—and to any hacker who gains access to that data or who sneaks a malicious tracker onto a shopping site.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003ch2\\u003e\\n  Privacy Protections\\n \\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  But many of the biggest supporters of virtual money have been hard at work trying to fix cryptocurrencies’ privacy shortcomings. The simplest solution is simply to remove blockchains from public view. Some financial firms have done this by segregating projects from established blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the network that hosts the second-biggest cryptocurrency. The firms themselves run these walled gardens and give certain people permission to access them. This provides privacy and much greater efficiency but is fundamentally unsuitable for a cryptocurrency open for anyone to use.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  A number of “tumbler” services make traceable cryptocurrencies more private by mixing many piles of money from different accounts. This obscures where each bit of digital money goes and who owns it. Though mixing makes coins harder to trace, it leaves some questions about whether there are enough mixing partners, whether deposits to and withdrawals from the pool are truly obscured, whether putting your money into a tumbler connects it with money being laundered, or even whether tumbling is itself an indication of money laundering.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Some developers are taking the more extreme step of creating entirely new, privacy-oriented currencies. One of the most prominent, Monero, uses three approaches to obscuring what’s happening on its blockchain. When someone sends a payment, it’s identified with a “ring signature” that includes cryptographic keys from multiple users, camouflaging the true sender. Similarly, the recipient of a payment is hidden, since each payment goes to “stealth address.” And RingCT, or ring confidential transactions, which Monero instituted in early 2017, cloak even the amount of money being transferred.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003ch2\\u003e\\n  Zero Knowledge Transactions\\n \\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  More recently, there has emerged a new currency that boasts a more sophisticated privacy safeguard. Zcash allows users to securely encrypt all their transaction information so that it’s completely unreadable. That itself is an easy task; computer scientists have many clever ways of keeping information private, such as the public key encryption employed in secure web-browsing and email systems.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  The trick, then, is verifying the data: if no one can see the details on the blockchain, how can you confirm that they’re correct? To do this, Zcash employs a new and frankly mind-boggling freak of math called a zk-SNARK. (The goofy-sounding name is an acronym for “zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge”—and aren’t you glad you asked.) The zk-SNARK is a special kind of proof that establishes the truth of a mathematical argument without revealing anything about what’s being proven. When a user makes a private Zcash transaction, it comes with a mathematically airtight assurance that it’s legitimate—that one account passed money to another and that it had enough Zcash to do so. Then a miner can look at the transaction, validate its proof, and record it in the blockchain for the world to see. Everyone can trust that the transaction is above board, even though no one knows the specifics of what happened. (The math is incredibly complex—well beyond the scope of this article. If you want more information, the Zcash site has\\n  \\u003ca href=\\\"https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks.html\\\"\\u003e\\n   a more in-depth overview\\n  \\u003c/a\\u003e\\n  and the Ethereum blog\\n  \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/\\\"\\u003e\\n   dives into the details\\n  \\u003c/a\\u003e\\n  .)\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003caside class=\\\"pulledquote\\\"\\u003e\\n  Zcash developers went to what, under other circumstances, would seem like pathological lengths.\\n \\u003c/aside\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Before integrating zk-SNARKS into the Zcash protocol, developers had to generate numbers called parameters that computers in the network would use to create and validate the proofs. But the process of creating parameters for public use also births an evil twin: a private counterpart that an unscrupulous person could use to secretly generate, out of the blue, a limitless amount of Zcash. (This wouldn’t compromise anyone else’s privacy or affect their accounts, but it could crash the value of the currency.)\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  To prevent anyone from monitoring the calculations and finding the private key—they refer to it as “toxic waste”—Zcash developers went to what, under other circumstances, would seem like pathological lengths. The parameters were generated in what developers called a “ceremony” in which six participants around the globe worked together in a carefully choreographed sequence. One person would do calculations on a computer not connected to the internet, burn the result to a DVD, walk the DVD over to a networked computer (crossing an unhackable “air gap”), securely send the data to another participant, who would burn it to another DVD, bring that to their airgapped computer for more calculations, and so on, for 27 tense yet boring hours.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  To further decrease the possibility of spying, the participants wrote their own software, bought all new computers from random stores, set up their computing stations in obscure motel rooms, physically removed all the communication hardware from the airgapped computers, and recorded every step of the process on video. One participant ran his calculations in a car driving across British Columbia, on a laptop held in a cardboard box lined with aluminum foil. After the ceremony, they erased all traces of the data through high-tech means like destroying the computer components with a grinder or blowtorch. If someone wanted to gain the power to generate Zcash at will, they would have to get the private “shard” from each participant and combine them to form the private key.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Zcash and Monero don’t just diverge in their technical approaches—their family trees are very different, too. Monero is a freewheeling affair run by a community of unpaid enthusiasts with a libertarian-anarchist vibe. Like Bitcoin, a significant amount of the early interest came from drug dealers and other users of the dark web looking to hide from the law. Zcash, in contrast, was launched by a company, with significant outside investment. For the first four years of the currency’s existence, 20% of the mined coins will go to the founders, investors, and a non-profit that looks after the protocol. (With Zcash’s current price at $481, that reward would have a total value of over $700 million.) Zcash hasn’t made as much headway in retail applications as Monero over its short life, but it has a technology partnership with JPMorgan, and they recently worked together to launch a zero-knowledge security option for a blockchain product offered by the bank. (The financial industry is interested in private blockchains because firms need to be able to trade secretly so competitors can’t horn in on their positions.) The two currencies have developed a rivalry, with each side trumpeting its own strengths and sniping criticisms at the other.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003ch2\\u003e\\n  Between Two Currencies\\n \\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  In truth, each of these leading privacy-oriented currencies has its own strengths and weaknesses. In April, two different research groups announced that they’d found significant problems in how Monero hid user information, which could let careful observers identify the accounts involved in many transactions, though not the identities of the people behind them. (The issues were mainly present in the currency before RingCT was released last year but persisted in milder forms even after that.) There were ways that careful users could avoid revealing their information, but people in general are notoriously bad at taking active steps to preserve their privacy. Like tumblers, Monero depends on exacting sequences of steps, and with all the information available on a public blockchain, there could be small leaks that reveal people’s information.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Zcash has an advantage in that privacy is baked right into the protocol, so users and computers running the software don’t need to take any action to hide their tracks. But the possibility of someone accessing the private key still casts a faint shadow of doubt over the currency, even after it’s been accepted by many users and has a cumulative market value of over $1 billion.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Peter Todd, the ceremony participant who did his calculations from the mobile compute station driving across Canada, says the security measures were not as ironclad as they appeared. For instance, he points out that if the software for creating the parameters was compromised and made to generate “random” numbers that were not so random, a hacker might be able to recreate the private key and mint their own Zcash. Moreover, he says that even if the ceremony was safe, the high-powered math behind Zcash might not be. “zk-SNARKs are a very sophisticated mathematical technique, but you’ve got to remember how novel this math is,” he\\n  \\u003ca href=\\\"http://fortune.com/go/finance/jp-morgan-bitcoin-zcash-wilcox/\\\"\\u003e\\n   told\\n   \\u003cem\\u003e\\n    Fortune\\n   \\u003c/em\\u003e\\n   magazine\\n  \\u003c/a\\u003e\\n  . “It would not surprise me and many other cryptographers if, in the future, that math got broken, making the entire system no longer secure.”\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  Many of the developers working on the two currencies acknowledge these shortcomings and are working hard on fixes. Monero, for example, plans to continue to refine its dummy transactions so as to better hide the real ones. Zcash is planning a major upgrade to its code that will include a second ceremony, in which hundreds or even thousands of people will participate. For the currency to be safe from a would-be private-key villain, they’ll need just one of them to successfully destroy their private shard.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n \\u003cp\\u003e\\n  At this point, it’s hard to predict whether these developers will succeed in providing secure, powerful ways for regular internet users to exchange value online. But money, brainpower, and optimism are all in abundant supply. These are hopeful days for cryptocurrencies.\\n \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/section\\u003e\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n      \\u003cp\\u003e\\n Photo credits: Gal Vallerius/Wayback Machine, Axel

That particular day was more or less flawless weather—beautiful day, blue sky. I don't remember the temperature, but we had an unseasonably warm fall, and I'm assuming that that day was equally pleasant.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI have been at Euro Brokers for over 29 years now. I started as a trainee broker in 1973, and for the last 14 or 15 years I've been in management. Most recently my title's been Executive Vice President. I've been one of several people who manage the company. One minor responsibility I had that turned out to be significant that day, however, was I was one of about eight or 10 people that had volunteered to be a fire marshal.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe first plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAs I said, I arrived about 7:15 and got my morning coffee. I went about my normal chores. I don't really recall any extraordinary events that morning until 8:46 and change, when, sitting with my back to the west wall—I had a private office, with my desk facing my door and my back to the window—I heard an enormous \\u003cem\\u003ethump.\\u003c/em\\u003e I didn't feel any vibration, but there was a noticeable sound like a \\u003cem\\u003eboom\\u003c/em\\u003e or \\u003cem\\u003ethump,\\u003c/em\\u003e and the lights buzzed for a second. My eyes jerked up to look at my overhead lights.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThe entire airspace behind me was filled with flame.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was suddenly this glare, and my attention was immediately caught. I spun my head around, and the entire airspace behind me was filled with flame. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it was the fuel from the first jet hitting the North Tower that had gone right through that tower and out over the airspace, south of Tower One, the North Tower. That same airspace was west of the South Tower, the tower I was in on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tMy immediate thought was there had been an explosion one or two floors above our office. That's what I thought had happened in that first instant. Being one of the fire marshals, I was equipped with a whistle and flashlight in my office. I jumped up, grabbed them, put the whistle around my neck, and more or less yelled, \\\"Get out! Everybody get out!\\\" This all took me five seconds. When I looked behind me out the window, the flames were all gone, and thousands of papers were just fluttering in the air, the edges of which were all on fire. It was like flaming confetti. Very strange.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI should have realized but didn't realize at the time that the area that all this was happening in was so huge. But I still wasn't computing that in my mind; still it was two floors up in my mind. So I ran out of my office, just a yard or two into an area where some accountants sit, and other people in offices, and I said, \\\"Come on, let's go, there has been an explosion,\\\" and I started to get people off the floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, we are a trading operation. Our customers are not individuals, but large financial trading institutions around the world, like a Barclay's Bank or the Royal Bank of Canada. So we have in our trading floor many television sets tuned to financial news information. Well, all of these stations cut away to their news departments, and there were these breaking news stories that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. The story developed literally within minutes, and we understood fairly soon, I would say within three or four minutes, that an airliner had hit One World Trade Center. At least that's my recollection of the timeframe.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWell, we knew now that the damage had been done to Tower One, not our Tower, so we relaxed a little bit about evacuation. Nonetheless, many people in the first minute had bolted for the stairs and were on their way down. Good news in retrospect, but at the time it was like, Oh boy, I guess we don't have to leave. The TV sets were telling us, and now there were photographs of One World Trade Center and the smoke coming out of the upper floors, I think the 92\\u003csup\\u003end\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and above. The fire marshals like myself were content to let people go or stay. Really, in a way, it didn't matter.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI called my wife and told her, \\\"You know, you won't believe this but Tower One has been hit. We are fine where we are. Relax, turn on the TV, there is a developing story there, find out what's happening.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe announcement\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt about five minutes to nine there was an announcement by the Port Authority within our building. First the strobe lights flashed, as they did during their normal fire drills. The alarm system gave a little bit of a \\u003cem\\u003ewhoop whoop\\u003c/em\\u003e, you know, to alert you to an announcement about to be made. Then the very familiar voice, the one we heard all the time, came over the system and said, \\\"Building Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two. If you are in the midst of evacuation, you may return to your office by using the re-entry doors on the re-entry floors and the elevators to return to your office. Repeat, Building Two is secure....\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t's man saved my life.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAcross the road you could see some people standing in doorways protecting themselves from anything that might have been falling. We ran across the street, past the fire hall, which is on the corner, and up another block and caught our breath. There was a deli owner there. I said, \\\"Have you got any water?\\\" He went in and just handed us this water in bottles and said, \\\"Here you go.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\" He said, \\\"In fact, here is a breakfast platter. I don't think anybody is going to be picking that up.\\\" And he gave me this great tray with some fresh fruit on it and some sweet rolls. He was a very generous fellow at the time considering the conditions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI carried this with me another block to the west side of Trinity Church, where we met a couple of ministers. That's when Stanley broke down. He cried to these ministers, \\\"This man saved my life.\\\" He completely broke down. I was overcome with emotion as well, and I said, \\\"You know, Stanley, you may think I saved your life but I think you saved my life, too. You got me out of that argument as to whether I should go up or go down. I'm here, and I'm fine, and it's because of your voice in the darkness that I made it.\\\" We embraced, and the ministers had a quick prayer, and one of them said, \\\"You know, the church is open if you would like to go in there.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe collapse\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tStanley and I looked at each other, and we nodded and said, \\\"All right, let's do that.\\\" So we walked to the south side of Trinity Church, which is a street that slopes up. As we walked up it we got higher and higher, and with the wall in relation to us going lower, we could now turn around and see the World Trade Center. We grabbed onto the fence railing of the cemetery and looked through the grate up at the Trade Center, and Stanley said to me, \\\"You know, I think those buildings could go down.\\\" I said, \\\"There is no way. Those are steel structures. That's furniture and paper and carpeting and draperies and things like that that are burning.\\\" But I didn't finish the sentence when Tower Two started to slide down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI would say that we'd been out of the building maybe five minutes when the building collapsed. It disappeared into its own dust. What I thought had happened at that instant was only the top third or quarter of the building down to the fire line had collapsed. It was a horrible feeling. I mean, our whole escape was horrible when it was happening, but you at least thought people had a chance—until that moment. Then I knew that certainly in the top quarter of the tower there was no chance. We just stared at it in awe, not realizing what was happening completely.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stared, watching, with nobody running or anything initially. But then this great tsunami of dust came over the church. Everybody looked up, and, as in a disaster movie, everybody started running in fear of the debris and dust that might be in there. But I knew there was nothing solid that was going to harm me, that the building hadn't fallen over. I knew that. But you didn't want to breathe the junk that was in there, so we ran down Broadway to 42 Broadway. We went into that building as the dust and smoke was catching up to our backsides. We got into that lobby with many other people, strangers doing the same thing. The air was clean in there, and people were milling around.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI realized then that I was still carrying the silly fruit platter, so I plumped that down on the reception desk there, and people started digging into it. It was an odd thing that I didn't just chuck it aside when I was running. I wasn't even aware that I was carrying it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stayed for at least half an hour, I suppose. The ash settled. We went out the east side of that building, which was onto New Street. It was like a winter's day, grey sky. I suppose it was a quarter of an inch of dust and ash everywhere, but it looked like freshly fallen fine snow. We walked in amazement down the street. I was still thinking, of course, that only the top part of the tower had slid off or slid into itself or something like that. No cell phones, no land lines were working. There was no way to communicate with anybody by telephone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe wandered over to the east side of Manhattan, the East River. Stanley gave me his business card, and thank goodness he did, because in the crowd that was walking, he and I suddenly got parted. He just disappeared into the crowd. I yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone. I was very grateful I had his business card at that point, because I knew that he was real. My initial thought was, Whoa, this was an angel; this didn't happen. It was a strange feeling that slipped over me. But, hey, I had his business card, so I knew he was real.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe ferry\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI wandered up FDR Drive on the east side of the island, thinking I was going to have to walk to mid-town to somehow get home to northern New Jersey where I live. But in this fog, in this white, wintry day, I heard someone on a bullhorn, \\\"Next ferry for Jersey City.\\\" That's strange, I thought. I didn't even know there were ferries over here. Well, what the ferry company had done was reroute their ferries to the east side of the island; there's a pier over there, Pier 11. I thought, This is wonderful.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI jumped on that ferry. They certainly weren't charging. We sailed around the southern tip of Manhattan, up the Hudson River, and as we got parallel to the World Trade Center—the wind was blowing from north to south that day—it was then that I and many other people realized for the first time that both towers were completely down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThis building I had worked in for 27 years was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI also realized that the first hint that I'd had of the second tower, that is, Tower One, coming down was when I had gotten on that ferry 15 minutes earlier, because a black cloud had enveloped the boat as I was getting on it. It was noticeable that with the South Tower, the one that fell first, the ensuing ash was white and grey, whereas with the second tower that fell, the North Tower, it was black. Now, if that was because it burned longer or what I don't know, but it was a noticeable difference.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tBut as we got parallel we could look over and see that both towers were gone. It was just a surreal feeling. Disbelief. How could this happen? Of course, at the time we knew nothing about the planes being hijacked, nothing about the Pentagon, nothing about the plane going down in Pennsylvania, or the FAA getting all planes out of the air. We were completely in the dark. But we could look off to the Trade Center on our right and see that this building I had worked in for 27 years was gone. It was a staggering thought. There was silence. People just couldn't believe it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe homecoming\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe sailed in silence to Harborside in Jersey City and got off the ferry. Well, I ran to the ticket booth. I think I was the first person there. I asked the lady if I could use the phone, and she said, \\\"Absolutely.\\\" I called my wife, and I could hear the cheers back at home. This is now about 11:15, I think, and my building came down sometime around 10 a.m. The last time I had talked to my wife was at about 20 to 10, so for over an hour and a half she had no idea where I was. Certainly for an hour and 15 minutes she had seen the tower down and was quite beside herself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFortunately, the house was full of people. My wife, Dianne, had some neighbors there, members of our church, our minister. My older son, his wife and three children were there, along with my older daughter and my younger son and his fiancé. My youngest daughter is at school in Toronto, so she wasn't there, but it was a house full of people. So when I called, there was a great cheer of relief and just agony relieved.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThey wanted to come and get me. I said, \\\"Well, look, I know the traffic in the area will be horrible.\\\" So I ended up, with hundreds of other people, walking about a mile north. I was pretty tired at this point, but I walked that mile to the Hoboken train terminal. As I walked into the terminal at five to noon, there was an announcement that the 11:30 train, which had been delayed, would be leaving in five minutes. \\\"All aboard for such and such a station,\\\" which was the station I needed to go to. So there was another bit of luck. I got on the train, and it left five minutes later.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI rode all the way to my station, got in my car, and drove the next 15 minutes to my home. When I hit the driveway, I honked the horn awfully loudly many times. There was then a front lawn full of tears and a reunion, and then for days the telephone didn't stop ringing. It was friends from all over the world, media, widows. (You know, we wouldn't call them widows at the time; their husbands were missing.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, Ronnie, who I told you had gone up to the 91\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and later told me he panicked and went down, when he exited the building it was at the very time when Tower Two was starting to fall. So the moment I was watching the building from Trinity Church was exactly the moment he was coming out of the same place I did, and he was caught in an explosion. He heard the explosion, swirled around, and a fireball was rushing at him from right at the doors where he was about to leave the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tWe lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe put his hands up in front of his face and got blown many, many yards across Liberty Street, which I'd run across earlier. He was severely burned in the arm, he had head wounds, cracked vertebrae. He doesn't remember really what happened right after that, but he ended up at St. Vincent's Hospital. They called his wife and told her he was fine, but she was unable to get to him for a couple of days because all the routes and tunnels were closed; they weren't allowing access back into Manhattan.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe didn't remember much those first several days, but he is now back at work on a part-time basis recovering and doing a great job. He's one of the heroes in my mind, because of that determination to get out.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThat's my story. It was a long, horrific day, but for me it turned out all right. For many others, I'm deeply saddened that they aren't here. We lost 61 people in total, some of whom I think were either caught in elevators coming back to the office or had come back to the office. We'll never know for sure whether it was a wingtip and flames that caused their demise right on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor in the east side of the building, where a lot of our traders were, or whether it was smoke when they went higher, or whether it was the collapse of the building. Nonetheless, as I say, we lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\nlding Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two.'\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAnd they went through the whole story again. So this was reinforcement that there was no need to evacuate. I am strictly guessing but I would think we were perhaps down to about 25 people left on our floor at the time of the announcement. (I had gone for a walk through our office.) Now, as I say, the pressure was off, and there wasn't a panic, although we were greatly concerned about what was going on in Tower One.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tIf you went to the north wall windows, you could look up and see the flames and the smoke and regrettably people now starting to jump, because of heat, smoke, or whatever it was. I'm only telling this secondhand because I personally could not take myself to the window to view that. I just didn't want that image burned in my brain, and I'm forever grateful that I didn't go and take in that sight.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tOne girl in particular—Susan her name was—turned from the window when she noticed the first person (for her) jump. She hadn't noticed it before, and she spun around in tears almost frantically, ran to me, and said \\\"Oh, Brian, it's terrible. People are dying.\\\" I said, \\\"Susan, it's a terrible tragedy,\\\" and I put my arms around her, and I said \\\"Come on, let's get you more composed,\\\" and we walked out of the trading floor down the hall. In the building the center core was crossed hallways. There was a north-south hallway and an east-west hallway. I walked with her from the east side through the center core to the west side, where the ladies room was, and she went into the ladies room. (Regrettably, Susan did not survive the eventual collapse of the building.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe second plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI continued on to the west side near my office. I was fairly near the windows talking with two or three people, including especially Bobby Coll. I was looking him in the eye having a conversation with him when at apparently 9:03—I didn't check my watch—the second plane hit the south side of our building at approximately the 78\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e, 79\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e, and 80\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floors. Our room fell apart at that moment, a complete destruction without an explosion—very strange things. The lights went out, but we were near the window so there was daylight. Again, there was this sort of \\u003cem\\u003ethump\\u003c/em\\u003e, this explosion without fire and flame, a very strange sensation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI just felt in my heart, \\u003cem\\u003eOh my gosh, we are going over.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was a twist, if you like, to the building when it got hit, and therefore the plane's hitting explained some things to me later, like why the ceiling fell apart. The ceiling tiles and some of the brackets and so on fell; some air conditioning ducts, speakers, cables, and things like that that were in the ceiling fell. I seem to have a sense that some of the floor tiles even buckled a bit or were moved. Some of the walls, I recall vaguely, were actually torn in a jagged direction rather than up and down. Again perhaps explained by the torque, some of the door frames popped out of the wall and partially fell or fully fell.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFor seven to 10 seconds there was this enormous sway in the building. It was one way, and I just felt in my heart, Oh my gosh, we are going over. That's what it felt like. Now, on windy days prior to that there was a little bit of a sway to the building. You got used to it; you didn't notice it. The window blinds would go \\u003cem\\u003eclack clack\\u003c/em\\u003e as they swung. As I said, for a good seven to ten seconds I thought it was over—horrible feeling—but then the building righted itself. It didn't sway back and forth; it just went one way, it seemed, and then back, and we were stable again.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI was looking at Bobby Coll square in the eyes, and we knew in an instant that it was terrorism. I mean, there wasn't for sure terrorism on people's minds when the first building had been hit. Was it pilot error? Was it instrument error? Or just a one-off suicide? Horrible as it was, you didn't know for certain that it was terrorism. But when the second building got hit you instantly calculated the two of them: terrorism.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe evacuation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tSo we knew we were in a difficult situation at that point in time. I fortunately had a flashlight with me, and I'm glad I did. I switched it on, and we started out of the room. Our room was not black with smoke but sort of white with chalky construction dust. It was incredibly dusty and dirty as we made our way out of the room and over some debris that had fallen from the ceiling and so on past the ladies room where I had taken Susan maybe 10 minutes earlier, and we went to this center core, this crossroads in the middle of the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt that point, had we gone three or four yards straight ahead to the east, we would have come to Stairway B. I have no idea what condition it was in because we didn't know what had happened, we didn't know where this plane had hit, we didn't know if it was a plane, we didn't know anything other than suddenly we were in chaos and our building had been hit. I could have turned right three yards to Stairway C, closer to the impact point. I had no idea what condition that stairway was in. Miraculously, at random I turned left to Stairway A, which on the floor plate is the farthest from where the impact really was.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t'\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"Brian Clark\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"268\\\" width=\\\"215\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/twin-towers-survivor-story-01.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eBrian Clark in his office on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor of the South Tower, about a year before the attack\\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003eCourtesy Brian Clark\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tLike any normal day I arrived at about 7:15 in the morning. That particular day was more or less flawless weather—beautiful day, blue sky. I don't remember the temperature, but we had an unseasonably warm fall, and I'm assuming that that day was equally pleasant.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI have been at Euro Brokers for over 29 years now. I started as a trainee broker in 1973, and for the last 14 or 15 years I've been in management. Most recently my title's been Executive Vice President. I've been one of several people who manage the company. One minor responsibility I had that turned out to be significant that day, however, was I was one of about eight or 10 people that had volunteered to be a fire marshal.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe first plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAs I said, I arrived about 7:15 and got my morning coffee. I went about my normal chores. I don't really recall any extraordinary events that morning until 8:46 and change, when, sitting with my back to the west wall—I had a private office, with my desk facing my door and my back to the window—I heard an enormous \\u003cem\\u003ethump.\\u003c/em\\u003e I didn't feel any vibration, but there was a noticeable sound like a \\u003cem\\u003eboom\\u003c/em\\u003e or \\u003cem\\u003ethump,\\u003c/em\\u003e and the lights buzzed for a second. My eyes jerked up to look at my overhead lights.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThe entire airspace behind me was filled with flame.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was suddenly this glare, and my attention was immediately caught. I spun my head around, and the entire airspace behind me was filled with flame. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it was the fuel from the first jet hitting the North Tower that had gone right through that tower and out over the airspace, south of Tower One, the North Tower. That same airspace was west of the South Tower, the tower I was in on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tMy immediate thought was there had been an explosion one or two floors above our office. That's what I thought had happened in that first instant. Being one of the fire marshals, I was equipped with a whistle and flashlight in my office. I jumped up, grabbed them, put the whistle around my neck, and more or less yelled, \\\"Get out! Everybody get out!\\\" This all took me five seconds. When I looked behind me out the window, the flames were all gone, and thousands of papers were just fluttering in the air, the edges of which were all on fire. It was like flaming confetti. Very strange.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI should have realized but didn't realize at the time that the area that all this was happening in was so huge. But I still wasn't computing that in my mind; still it was two floors up in my mind. So I ran out of my office, just a yard or two into an area where some accountants sit, and other people in offices, and I said, \\\"Come on, let's go, there has been an explosion,\\\" and I started to get people off the floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, we are a trading operation. Our customers are not individuals, but large financial trading institutions around the world, like a Barclay's Bank or the Royal Bank of Canada. So we have in our trading floor many television sets tuned to financial news information. Well, all of these stations cut away to their news departments, and there were these breaking news stories that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. The story developed literally within minutes, and we understood fairly soon, I would say within three or four minutes, that an airliner had hit One World Trade Center. At least that's my recollection of the timeframe.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWell, we knew now that the damage had been done to Tower One, not our Tower, so we relaxed a little bit about evacuation. Nonetheless, many people in the first minute had bolted for the stairs and were on their way down. Good news in retrospect, but at the time it was like, Oh boy, I guess we don't have to leave. The TV sets were telling us, and now there were photographs of One World Trade Center and the smoke coming out of the upper floors, I think the 92\\u003csup\\u003end\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and above. The fire marshals like myself were content to let people go or stay. Really, in a way, it didn't matter.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI called my wife and told her, \\\"You know, you won't believe this but Tower One has been hit. We are fine where we are. Relax, turn on the TV, there is a developing story there, find out what's happening.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe announcement\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt about five minutes to nine there was an announcement by the Port Authority within our building. First the strobe lights flashed, as they did during their normal fire drills. The alarm system gave a little bit of a \\u003cem\\u003ewhoop whoop\\u003c/em\\u003e, you know, to alert you to an announcement about to be made. Then the very familiar voice, the one we heard all the time, came over the system and said, \\\"Building Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two. If you are in the midst of evacuation, you may return to your office by using the re-entry doors on the re-entry floors and the elevators to return to your office. Repeat, Building Two is secure....\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t's man saved my life.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAcross the road you could see some people standing in doorways protecting themselves from anything that might have been falling. We ran across the street, past the fire hall, which is on the corner, and up another block and caught our breath. There was a deli owner there. I said, \\\"Have you got any water?\\\" He went in and just handed us this water in bottles and said, \\\"Here you go.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\" He said, \\\"In fact, here is a breakfast platter. I don't think anybody is going to be picking that up.\\\" And he gave me this great tray with some fresh fruit on it and some sweet rolls. He was a very generous fellow at the time considering the conditions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI carried this with me another block to the west side of Trinity Church, where we met a couple of ministers. That's when Stanley broke down. He cried to these ministers, \\\"This man saved my life.\\\" He completely broke down. I was overcome with emotion as well, and I said, \\\"You know, Stanley, you may think I saved your life but I think you saved my life, too. You got me out of that argument as to whether I should go up or go down. I'm here, and I'm fine, and it's because of your voice in the darkness that I made it.\\\" We embraced, and the ministers had a quick prayer, and one of them said, \\\"You know, the church is open if you would like to go in there.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe collapse\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tStanley and I looked at each other, and we nodded and said, \\\"All right, let's do that.\\\" So we walked to the south side of Trinity Church, which is a street that slopes up. As we walked up it we got higher and higher, and with the wall in relation to us going lower, we could now turn around and see the World Trade Center. We grabbed onto the fence railing of the cemetery and looked through the grate up at the Trade Center, and Stanley said to me, \\\"You know, I think those buildings could go down.\\\" I said, \\\"There is no way. Those are steel structures. That's furniture and paper and carpeting and draperies and things like that that are burning.\\\" But I didn't finish the sentence when Tower Two started to slide down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI would say that we'd been out of the building maybe five minutes when the building collapsed. It disappeared into its own dust. What I thought had happened at that instant was only the top third or quarter of the building down to the fire line had collapsed. It was a horrible feeling. I mean, our whole escape was horrible when it was happening, but you at least thought people had a chance—until that moment. Then I knew that certainly in the top quarter of the tower there was no chance. We just stared at it in awe, not realizing what was happening completely.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stared, watching, with nobody running or anything initially. But then this great tsunami of dust came over the church. Everybody looked up, and, as in a disaster movie, everybody started running in fear of the debris and dust that might be in there. But I knew there was nothing solid that was going to harm me, that the building hadn't fallen over. I knew that. But you didn't want to breathe the junk that was in there, so we ran down Broadway to 42 Broadway. We went into that building as the dust and smoke was catching up to our backsides. We got into that lobby with many other people, strangers doing the same thing. The air was clean in there, and people were milling around.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI realized then that I was still carrying the silly fruit platter, so I plumped that down on the reception desk there, and people started digging into it. It was an odd thing that I didn't just chuck it aside when I was running. I wasn't even aware that I was carrying it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stayed for at least half an hour, I suppose. The ash settled. We went out the east side of that building, which was onto New Street. It was like a winter's day, grey sky. I suppose it was a quarter of an inch of dust and ash everywhere, but it looked like freshly fallen fine snow. We walked in amazement down the street. I was still thinking, of course, that only the top part of the tower had slid off or slid into itself or something like that. No cell phones, no land lines were working. There was no way to communicate with anybody by telephone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe wandered over to the east side of Manhattan, the East River. Stanley gave me his business card, and thank goodness he did, because in the crowd that was walking, he and I suddenly got parted. He just disappeared into the crowd. I yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone. I was very grateful I had his business card at that point, because I knew that he was real. My initial thought was, Whoa, this was an angel; this didn't happen. It was a strange feeling that slipped over me. But, hey, I had his business card, so I knew he was real.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe ferry\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI wandered up FDR Drive on the east side of the island, thinking I was going to have to walk to mid-town to somehow get home to northern New Jersey where I live. But in this fog, in this white, wintry day, I heard someone on a bullhorn, \\\"Next ferry for Jersey City.\\\" That's strange, I thought. I didn't even know there were ferries over here. Well, what the ferry company had done was reroute their ferries to the east side of the island; there's a pier over there, Pier 11. I thought, This is wonderful.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI jumped on that ferry. They certainly weren't charging. We sailed around the southern tip of Manhattan, up the Hudson River, and as we got parallel to the World Trade Center—the wind was blowing from north to south that day—it was then that I and many other people realized for the first time that both towers were completely down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThis building I had worked in for 27 years was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI also realized that the first hint that I'd had of the second tower, that is, Tower One, coming down was when I had gotten on that ferry 15 minutes earlier, because a black cloud had enveloped the boat as I was getting on it. It was noticeable that with the South Tower, the one that fell first, the ensuing ash was white and grey, whereas with the second tower that fell, the North Tower, it was black. Now, if that was because it burned longer or what I don't know, but it was a noticeable difference.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tBut as we got parallel we could look over and see that both towers were gone. It was just a surreal feeling. Disbelief. How could this happen? Of course, at the time we knew nothing about the planes being hijacked, nothing about the Pentagon, nothing about the plane going down in Pennsylvania, or the FAA getting all planes out of the air. We were completely in the dark. But we could look off to the Trade Center on our right and see that this building I had worked in for 27 years was gone. It was a staggering thought. There was silence. People just couldn't believe it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe homecoming\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe sailed in silence to Harborside in Jersey City and got off the ferry. Well, I ran to the ticket booth. I think I was the first person there. I asked the lady if I could use the phone, and she said, \\\"Absolutely.\\\" I called my wife, and I could hear the cheers back at home. This is now about 11:15, I think, and my building came down sometime around 10 a.m. The last time I had talked to my wife was at about 20 to 10, so for over an hour and a half she had no idea where I was. Certainly for an hour and 15 minutes she had seen the tower down and was quite beside herself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFortunately, the house was full of people. My wife, Dianne, had some neighbors there, members of our church, our minister. My older son, his wife and three children were there, along with my older daughter and my younger son and his fiancé. My youngest daughter is at school in Toronto, so she wasn't there, but it was a house full of people. So when I called, there was a great cheer of relief and just agony relieved.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThey wanted to come and get me. I said, \\\"Well, look, I know the traffic in the area will be horrible.\\\" So I ended up, with hundreds of other people, walking about a mile north. I was pretty tired at this point, but I walked that mile to the Hoboken train terminal. As I walked into the terminal at five to noon, there was an announcement that the 11:30 train, which had been delayed, would be leaving in five minutes. \\\"All aboard for such and such a station,\\\" which was the station I needed to go to. So there was another bit of luck. I got on the train, and it left five minutes later.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI rode all the way to my station, got in my car, and drove the next 15 minutes to my home. When I hit the driveway, I honked the horn awfully loudly many times. There was then a front lawn full of tears and a reunion, and then for days the telephone didn't stop ringing. It was friends from all over the world, media, widows. (You know, we wouldn't call them widows at the time; their husbands were missing.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, Ronnie, who I told you had gone up to the 91\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and later told me he panicked and went down, when he exited the building it was at the very time when Tower Two was starting to fall. So the moment I was watching the building from Trinity Church was exactly the moment he was coming out of the same place I did, and he was caught in an explosion. He heard the explosion, swirled around, and a fireball was rushing at him from right at the doors where he was about to leave the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tWe lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe put his hands up in front of his face and got blown many, many yards across Liberty Street, which I'd run across earlier. He was severely burned in the arm, he had head wounds, cracked vertebrae. He doesn't remember really what happened right after that, but he ended up at St. Vincent's Hospital. They called his wife and told her he was fine, but she was unable to get to him for a couple of days because all the routes and tunnels were closed; they weren't allowing access back into Manhattan.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe didn't remember much those first several days, but he is now back at work on a part-time basis recovering and doing a great job. He's one of the heroes in my mind, because of that determination to get out.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThat's my story. It was a long, horrific day, but for me it turned out all right. For many others, I'm deeply saddened that they aren't here. We lost 61 people in total, some of whom I think were either caught in elevators coming back to the office or had come back to the office. We'll never know for sure whether it was a wingtip and flames that caused their demise right on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor in the east side of the building, where a lot of our traders were, or whether it was smoke when they went higher, or whether it was the collapse of the building. Nonetheless, as I say, we lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n*\\no we started down that stairway. We only went three floors. There was a group of seven of us, myself and six others. I remember some of the names. Now, I know everybody at Euro Brokers, but in my mind somehow I blanked out who those other grey shapes were; they were farther up the stairs a bit, not in the light of the flashlight. I do remember Bobby Coll, Kevin York, David Vera, and Ron DiFrancesco.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe met two people that had come up from the 80\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, a heavy-set woman and by comparison a rather frail male companion of hers, a workmate. She was saying from the landing below, \\\"Stop, stop you've got to go up,\\\" and she labored up to join us, moving very slowly; she was such a big woman. She said, \\\"You've got to go up. You can't go down. There is too much smoke and flames below.\\\" I had my flashlight, and I was shining it in each face as people made comments, and an argument ensued as to what we should do.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe rescue\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt the same moment as this argument was going on I heard \\u003cem\\u003ebang, bang, bang, thump, thump, thump,\\u003c/em\\u003e \\\"Help! Help! I'm buried. I can't breathe. Is anybody there? Can you help me?,\\\" a strange voice coming from within the 81\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor. I heard this voice, and it caused me to lose concentration in this argument that was going on about whether to head up or down. I grabbed Ron by the sleeve, and I said \\\"Come on, Ron. Let's get this fellow.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThe fire escape door had blown away from the wall a bit, but we were able to push the dry wall back and step between the door frame and the dry wall, squeeze onto the 81\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, which was in darkness, but again I had my flashlight. I scanned the room, and I said, \\\"Who's there? Where are you?\\\" He said, \\\"Oh, I can see your light.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWhat my light beam was showing me was similar to being on a very foggy road at night, because it was white dust everywhere. He said, \\\"No, to the right ... to the left ...\\\" In about a minute, Ron and I located his voice. He said, \\\"Can you see my hand?\\\" His hand was sticking out of the wall, or not the wall but this area where he was covered and blocked by some debris. He was waving his hand frantically, and my light picked up his hand. I said, \\\"Okay, see you now.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAnd at that moment my associate Ron who came down with me was overcome with smoke. He had a gym bag or a briefcase with him, and he was sort of putting it in front of his face in an attempt to filter the air. It clearly wasn't working, and Ron, with eyes shut, backed off the floor. He was almost completely overcome by the smoke.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAgain, miraculously, I was in a bubble. I was breathing fine. I was squinting a bit, but I could work, and I struggled to get debris away from Stanley—I found out later his name was Stanley Praimnath; he worked at Fuji Bank.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe got to the point I couldn't do any more work from my side, and I said, \\\"You've got to jump. You've got to get over this last barrier.\\\" Well, he jumped once and fell back down. I said, \\\"Come on, you've got to do this. It's the only way out.\\\" I reached in again, and Stanley jumped, and I got him by the collar or the shoulder or somewhere there. He said later that I just pulled him up like Superman. I don't remember having this extraordinary strength, but he says it really did happen that way. I pulled him out and onto me, and we fell in a heap and embraced. It was an exciting moment, it really was.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t'lding Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAnd they went through the whole story again. So this was reinforcement that there was no need to evacuate. I am strictly guessing but I would think we were perhaps down to about 25 people left on our floor at the time of the announcement. (I had gone for a walk through our office.) Now, as I say, the pressure was off, and there wasn't a panic, although we were greatly concerned about what was going on in Tower One.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tIf you went to the north wall windows, you could look up and see the flames and the smoke and regrettably people now starting to jump, because of heat, smoke, or whatever it was. I'm only telling this secondhand because I personally could not take myself to the window to view that. I just didn't want that image burned in my brain, and I'm forever grateful that I didn't go and take in that sight.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tOne girl in particular—Susan her name was—turned from the window when she noticed the first person (for her) jump. She hadn't noticed it before, and she spun around in tears almost frantically, ran to me, and said \\\"Oh, Brian, it's terrible. People are dying.\\\" I said, \\\"Susan, it's a terrible tragedy,\\\" and I put my arms around her, and I said \\\"Come on, let's get you more composed,\\\" and we walked out of the trading floor down the hall. In the building the center core was crossed hallways. There was a north-south hallway and an east-west hallway. I walked with her from the east side through the center core to the west side, where the ladies room was, and she went into the ladies room. (Regrettably, Susan did not survive the eventual collapse of the building.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe second plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI continued on to the west side near my office. I was fairly near the windows talking with two or three people, including especially Bobby Coll. I was looking him in the eye having a conversation with him when at apparently 9:03—I didn't check my watch—the second plane hit the south side of our building at approximately the 78\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e, 79\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e, and 80\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floors. Our room fell apart at that moment, a complete destruction without an explosion—very strange things. The lights went out, but we were near the window so there was daylight. Again, there was this sort of \\u003cem\\u003ethump\\u003c/em\\u003e, this explosion without fire and flame, a very strange sensation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI just felt in my heart, \\u003cem\\u003eOh my gosh, we are going over.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was a twist, if you like, to the building when it got hit, and therefore the plane's hitting explained some things to me later, like why the ceiling fell apart. The ceiling tiles and some of the brackets and so on fell; some air conditioning ducts, speakers, cables, and things like that that were in the ceiling fell. I seem to have a sense that some of the floor tiles even buckled a bit or were moved. Some of the walls, I recall vaguely, were actually torn in a jagged direction rather than up and down. Again perhaps explained by the torque, some of the door frames popped out of the wall and partially fell or fully fell.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFor seven to 10 seconds there was this enormous sway in the building. It was one way, and I just felt in my heart, Oh my gosh, we are going over. That's what it felt like. Now, on windy days prior to that there was a little bit of a sway to the building. You got used to it; you didn't notice it. The window blinds would go \\u003cem\\u003eclack clack\\u003c/em\\u003e as they swung. As I said, for a good seven to ten seconds I thought it was over—horrible feeling—but then the building righted itself. It didn't sway back and forth; it just went one way, it seemed, and then back, and we were stable again.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI was looking at Bobby Coll square in the eyes, and we knew in an instant that it was terrorism. I mean, there wasn't for sure terrorism on people's minds when the first building had been hit. Was it pilot error? Was it instrument error? Or just a one-off suicide? Horrible as it was, you didn't know for certain that it was terrorism. But when the second building got hit you instantly calculated the two of them: terrorism.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe evacuation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tSo we knew we were in a difficult situation at that point in time. I fortunately had a flashlight with me, and I'm glad I did. I switched it on, and we started out of the room. Our room was not black with smoke but sort of white with chalky construction dust. It was incredibly dusty and dirty as we made our way out of the room and over some debris that had fallen from the ceiling and so on past the ladies room where I had taken Susan maybe 10 minutes earlier, and we went to this center core, this crossroads in the middle of the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt that point, had we gone three or four yards straight ahead to the east, we would have come to Stairway B. I have no idea what condition it was in because we didn't know what had happened, we didn't know where this plane had hit, we didn't know if it was a plane, we didn't know anything other than suddenly we were in chaos and our building had been hit. I could have turned right three yards to Stairway C, closer to the impact point. I had no idea what condition that stairway was in. Miraculously, at random I turned left to Stairway A, which on the floor plate is the farthest from where the impact really was.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t'\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"Brian Clark\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"268\\\" width=\\\"215\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/twin-towers-survivor-story-01.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eBrian Clark in his office on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor of the South Tower, about a year before the attack\\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003eCourtesy Brian Clark\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tLike any normal day I arrived at about 7:15 in the morning. That particular day was more or less flawless weather—beautiful day, blue sky. I don't remember the temperature, but we had an unseasonably warm fall, and I'm assuming that that day was equally pleasant.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI have been at Euro Brokers for over 29 years now. I started as a trainee broker in 1973, and for the last 14 or 15 years I've been in management. Most recently my title's been Executive Vice President. I've been one of several people who manage the company. One minor responsibility I had that turned out to be significant that day, however, was I was one of about eight or 10 people that had volunteered to be a fire marshal.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe first plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAs I said, I arrived about 7:15 and got my morning coffee. I went about my normal chores. I don't really recall any extraordinary events that morning until 8:46 and change, when, sitting with my back to the west wall—I had a private office, with my desk facing my door and my back to the window—I heard an enormous \\u003cem\\u003ethump.\\u003c/em\\u003e I didn't feel any vibration, but there was a noticeable sound like a \\u003cem\\u003eboom\\u003c/em\\u003e or \\u003cem\\u003ethump,\\u003c/em\\u003e and the lights buzzed for a second. My eyes jerked up to look at my overhead lights.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThe entire airspace behind me was filled with flame.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was suddenly this glare, and my attention was immediately caught. I spun my head around, and the entire airspace behind me was filled with flame. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it was the fuel from the first jet hitting the North Tower that had gone right through that tower and out over the airspace, south of Tower One, the North Tower. That same airspace was west of the South Tower, the tower I was in on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tMy immediate thought was there had been an explosion one or two floors above our office. That's what I thought had happened in that first instant. Being one of the fire marshals, I was equipped with a whistle and flashlight in my office. I jumped up, grabbed them, put the whistle around my neck, and more or less yelled, \\\"Get out! Everybody get out!\\\" This all took me five seconds. When I looked behind me out the window, the flames were all gone, and thousands of papers were just fluttering in the air, the edges of which were all on fire. It was like flaming confetti. Very strange.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI should have realized but didn't realize at the time that the area that all this was happening in was so huge. But I still wasn't computing that in my mind; still it was two floors up in my mind. So I ran out of my office, just a yard or two into an area where some accountants sit, and other people in offices, and I said, \\\"Come on, let's go, there has been an explosion,\\\" and I started to get people off the floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, we are a trading operation. Our customers are not individuals, but large financial trading institutions around the world, like a Barclay's Bank or the Royal Bank of Canada. So we have in our trading floor many television sets tuned to financial news information. Well, all of these stations cut away to their news departments, and there were these breaking news stories that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. The story developed literally within minutes, and we understood fairly soon, I would say within three or four minutes, that an airliner had hit One World Trade Center. At least that's my recollection of the timeframe.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWell, we knew now that the damage had been done to Tower One, not our Tower, so we relaxed a little bit about evacuation. Nonetheless, many people in the first minute had bolted for the stairs and were on their way down. Good news in retrospect, but at the time it was like, Oh boy, I guess we don't have to leave. The TV sets were telling us, and now there were photographs of One World Trade Center and the smoke coming out of the upper floors, I think the 92\\u003csup\\u003end\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and above. The fire marshals like myself were content to let people go or stay. Really, in a way, it didn't matter.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI called my wife and told her, \\\"You know, you won't believe this but Tower One has been hit. We are fine where we are. Relax, turn on the TV, there is a developing story there, find out what's happening.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe announcement\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt about five minutes to nine there was an announcement by the Port Authority within our building. First the strobe lights flashed, as they did during their normal fire drills. The alarm system gave a little bit of a \\u003cem\\u003ewhoop whoop\\u003c/em\\u003e, you know, to alert you to an announcement about to be made. Then the very familiar voice, the one we heard all the time, came over the system and said, \\\"Building Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two. If you are in the midst of evacuation, you may return to your office by using the re-entry doors on the re-entry floors and the elevators to return to your office. Repeat, Building Two is secure....\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t's man saved my life.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAcross the road you could see some people standing in doorways protecting themselves from anything that might have been falling. We ran across the street, past the fire hall, which is on the corner, and up another block and caught our breath. There was a deli owner there. I said, \\\"Have you got any water?\\\" He went in and just handed us this water in bottles and said, \\\"Here you go.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\" He said, \\\"In fact, here is a breakfast platter. I don't think anybody is going to be picking that up.\\\" And he gave me this great tray with some fresh fruit on it and some sweet rolls. He was a very generous fellow at the time considering the conditions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI carried this with me another block to the west side of Trinity Church, where we met a couple of ministers. That's when Stanley broke down. He cried to these ministers, \\\"This man saved my life.\\\" He completely broke down. I was overcome with emotion as well, and I said, \\\"You know, Stanley, you may think I saved your life but I think you saved my life, too. You got me out of that argument as to whether I should go up or go down. I'm here, and I'm fine, and it's because of your voice in the darkness that I made it.\\\" We embraced, and the ministers had a quick prayer, and one of them said, \\\"You know, the church is open if you would like to go in there.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe collapse\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tStanley and I looked at each other, and we nodded and said, \\\"All right, let's do that.\\\" So we walked to the south side of Trinity Church, which is a street that slopes up. As we walked up it we got higher and higher, and with the wall in relation to us going lower, we could now turn around and see the World Trade Center. We grabbed onto the fence railing of the cemetery and looked through the grate up at the Trade Center, and Stanley said to me, \\\"You know, I think those buildings could go down.\\\" I said, \\\"There is no way. Those are steel structures. That's furniture and paper and carpeting and draperies and things like that that are burning.\\\" But I didn't finish the sentence when Tower Two started to slide down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI would say that we'd been out of the building maybe five minutes when the building collapsed. It disappeared into its own dust. What I thought had happened at that instant was only the top third or quarter of the building down to the fire line had collapsed. It was a horrible feeling. I mean, our whole escape was horrible when it was happening, but you at least thought people had a chance—until that moment. Then I knew that certainly in the top quarter of the tower there was no chance. We just stared at it in awe, not realizing what was happening completely.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stared, watching, with nobody running or anything initially. But then this great tsunami of dust came over the church. Everybody looked up, and, as in a disaster movie, everybody started running in fear of the debris and dust that might be in there. But I knew there was nothing solid that was going to harm me, that the building hadn't fallen over. I knew that. But you didn't want to breathe the junk that was in there, so we ran down Broadway to 42 Broadway. We went into that building as the dust and smoke was catching up to our backsides. We got into that lobby with many other people, strangers doing the same thing. The air was clean in there, and people were milling around.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI realized then that I was still carrying the silly fruit platter, so I plumped that down on the reception desk there, and people started digging into it. It was an odd thing that I didn't just chuck it aside when I was running. I wasn't even aware that I was carrying it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stayed for at least half an hour, I suppose. The ash settled. We went out the east side of that building, which was onto New Street. It was like a winter's day, grey sky. I suppose it was a quarter of an inch of dust and ash everywhere, but it looked like freshly fallen fine snow. We walked in amazement down the street. I was still thinking, of course, that only the top part of the tower had slid off or slid into itself or something like that. No cell phones, no land lines were working. There was no way to communicate with anybody by telephone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe wandered over to the east side of Manhattan, the East River. Stanley gave me his business card, and thank goodness he did, because in the crowd that was walking, he and I suddenly got parted. He just disappeared into the crowd. I yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone. I was very grateful I had his business card at that point, because I knew that he was real. My initial thought was, Whoa, this was an angel; this didn't happen. It was a strange feeling that slipped over me. But, hey, I had his business card, so I knew he was real.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe ferry\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI wandered up FDR Drive on the east side of the island, thinking I was going to have to walk to mid-town to somehow get home to northern New Jersey where I live. But in this fog, in this white, wintry day, I heard someone on a bullhorn, \\\"Next ferry for Jersey City.\\\" That's strange, I thought. I didn't even know there were ferries over here. Well, what the ferry company had done was reroute their ferries to the east side of the island; there's a pier over there, Pier 11. I thought, This is wonderful.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI jumped on that ferry. They certainly weren't charging. We sailed around the southern tip of Manhattan, up the Hudson River, and as we got parallel to the World Trade Center—the wind was blowing from north to south that day—it was then that I and many other people realized for the first time that both towers were completely down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThis building I had worked in for 27 years was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI also realized that the first hint that I'd had of the second tower, that is, Tower One, coming down was when I had gotten on that ferry 15 minutes earlier, because a black cloud had enveloped the boat as I was getting on it. It was noticeable that with the South Tower, the one that fell first, the ensuing ash was white and grey, whereas with the second tower that fell, the North Tower, it was black. Now, if that was because it burned longer or what I don't know, but it was a noticeable difference.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tBut as we got parallel we could look over and see that both towers were gone. It was just a surreal feeling. Disbelief. How could this happen? Of course, at the time we knew nothing about the planes being hijacked, nothing about the Pentagon, nothing about the plane going down in Pennsylvania, or the FAA getting all planes out of the air. We were completely in the dark. But we could look off to the Trade Center on our right and see that this building I had worked in for 27 years was gone. It was a staggering thought. There was silence. People just couldn't believe it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe homecoming\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe sailed in silence to Harborside in Jersey City and got off the ferry. Well, I ran to the ticket booth. I think I was the first person there. I asked the lady if I could use the phone, and she said, \\\"Absolutely.\\\" I called my wife, and I could hear the cheers back at home. This is now about 11:15, I think, and my building came down sometime around 10 a.m. The last time I had talked to my wife was at about 20 to 10, so for over an hour and a half she had no idea where I was. Certainly for an hour and 15 minutes she had seen the tower down and was quite beside herself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFortunately, the house was full of people. My wife, Dianne, had some neighbors there, members of our church, our minister. My older son, his wife and three children were there, along with my older daughter and my younger son and his fiancé. My youngest daughter is at school in Toronto, so she wasn't there, but it was a house full of people. So when I called, there was a great cheer of relief and just agony relieved.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThey wanted to come and get me. I said, \\\"Well, look, I know the traffic in the area will be horrible.\\\" So I ended up, with hundreds of other people, walking about a mile north. I was pretty tired at this point, but I walked that mile to the Hoboken train terminal. As I walked into the terminal at five to noon, there was an announcement that the 11:30 train, which had been delayed, would be leaving in five minutes. \\\"All aboard for such and such a station,\\\" which was the station I needed to go to. So there was another bit of luck. I got on the train, and it left five minutes later.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI rode all the way to my station, got in my car, and drove the next 15 minutes to my home. When I hit the driveway, I honked the horn awfully loudly many times. There was then a front lawn full of tears and a reunion, and then for days the telephone didn't stop ringing. It was friends from all over the world, media, widows. (You know, we wouldn't call them widows at the time; their husbands were missing.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, Ronnie, who I told you had gone up to the 91\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and later told me he panicked and went down, when he exited the building it was at the very time when Tower Two was starting to fall. So the moment I was watching the building from Trinity Church was exactly the moment he was coming out of the same place I did, and he was caught in an explosion. He heard the explosion, swirled around, and a fireball was rushing at him from right at the doors where he was about to leave the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tWe lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe put his hands up in front of his face and got blown many, many yards across Liberty Street, which I'd run across earlier. He was severely burned in the arm, he had head wounds, cracked vertebrae. He doesn't remember really what happened right after that, but he ended up at St. Vincent's Hospital. They called his wife and told her he was fine, but she was unable to get to him for a couple of days because all the routes and tunnels were closed; they weren't allowing access back into Manhattan.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe didn't remember much those first several days, but he is now back at work on a part-time basis recovering and doing a great job. He's one of the heroes in my mind, because of that determination to get out.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThat's my story. It was a long, horrific day, but for me it turned out all right. For many others, I'm deeply saddened that they aren't here. We lost 61 people in total, some of whom I think were either caught in elevators coming back to the office or had come back to the office. We'll never know for sure whether it was a wingtip and flames that caused their demise right on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor in the east side of the building, where a lot of our traders were, or whether it was smoke when they went higher, or whether it was the collapse of the building. Nonetheless, as I say, we lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n had to see my wife. I had to see my kids at all costs.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, Ron had gone. He had gone back to the stairway and was not there when we got back to the stairs. The other people had gone up as I left with Ron to go in on the 81\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor. I had this vision of Bobby Coll and Kevin York each with a hand under each elbow of this heavy-set woman starting to ascend the stairs, saying things like, \\\"Come on. We are in this together. We will help you. Relax, we'll be with you.\\\" And up they went. And Dave Vera, who had a walkie-talkie, started back up the stairs as well. That's the last I saw of those people.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, I didn't know whether Ron had gone up or down, I assumed down because he was with me going down. I learned later that Ron went up; in fact, he went all the way up to the 91\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor. He later told me that he lay on the floor there for 10 minutes until he panicked. He told me, \\\"I had to see my wife. I had to see my kids at all costs. I was gonna make it out.\\\" And he went to the stairway and went all the way down, following me, I guess, by five to seven minutes, because I took my time going down the stairway. It was not intentional; it was just that some events happened.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe descent\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tSo Stanley and I went back to the stairs on the 81\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, and we began down. The first five floors were difficult, because in certain areas dry wall had been blown off the wall and was lying propped up against the railing. We had to move it, shove it to the side. The sprinkler system had turned on and had started to do something, but it wasn't doing its job as it should, so there was water sloshing down the stairways. It was dark.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, the stairways didn't go straight down. There was one particular area around the 78\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, I think, where you actually came to some strange twists. So we had to figure that out in the darkness, but we made some fortunate decisions. Around the 74\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, I would say, we broke into what I call fresh air. The lights were on. It was normal conditions. There was not a problem breathing, and there was nobody there, not a soul, just Stanley and me. We were starting to have normal conversation. He was cut and bruised a bit, but he was fine conversing. I think he had his shirt off; he was just in his undershirt.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe continued on down. On the 68\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, we met one man walking up. The man's name was Jose Marrero. He worked for Euro Brokers for many years. He worked in our security department, and he was also one of our fire marshals. Jose, I learned later, had been with many people of ours all the way down into the 30s and 40s on the stairway and figured, I guess, that he had done his job. Then he heard Dave Vera, who had started down with me, on his walkie-talkie saying that he needed help; he was helping people, could he get help.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tHe was tending to a Caucasian male lying flat on the floor moaning in pain, with massive head wounds.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tSo Jose, hero that he was, was walking up, perspiring, carrying his walkie-talkie. He said, \\\"Oh, I can hear Dave above. I'm gonna help.\\\" I said, \\\"Jose, Dave's a big boy, he can get out. We've just come through hell to get here. Come on down with us.\\\" \\\"No, no, no,\\\" he said. \\\"I'll be fine. I can help.\\\" Then Jose kept marching up. Jose was about 35 years old and quite fit, but when I passed him he was understandably laboring to climb the stairs. But he kept going. I don't know how high he got or what he found.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tStanley and I continued down until we got to the 44\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor—straight shot, saw nobody. On the 44\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor we went off, because I knew that was one of the sky lobbies in the Trade Center. There were sky lobbies on the 44\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e and 78\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floors. Conditions on the 44\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor were normal other than there was nobody there, except for one—I'm guessing at his age—middle 60s, maybe 70s even Port Authority security guard who was tending to a Caucasian male lying flat on the floor moaning in pain, with massive head wounds. The security guard was saying, \\\"I need help. My phones don't work, but I need medical attention for this man. I'll stay with him, I'll tend him, but you must promise to get help as soon as you can telephone somebody.\\\" Stanley and I said \\\"okay\\\" and went back to the stair.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe conference room\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe went down again. Nobody on the stairway at all. Easy travel, just the two of us. Lights on, fresh air all the way down to the 31\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, where we went in at random and got into somebody's office. I don't know whether it was an advertising agency or a lawyer's office; I don't know whose it was. We got into their conference room, and each grabbed a phone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI called my wife to tell her here's where I am; we'll have this great celebration at home. I hadn't talked to her since about five to nine, I suppose, and this was about 20 to 10. My wife had turned on the TV, and the first thing she had seen was the second plane slam into our building. So she had no idea where I was for that 45-minute stretch. I told her I was fine. Stanley talked to his wife, told her similar news.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI then called 9-1-1—coincidence 9/11—and was put on hold. This was a disturbing thing at the time. I got ahold of them right away and told them about this fellow on the 44\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor that needed medical attention, but they put me on hold. They said, \\\"You must tell your story to somebody higher up the chain\\\" and clicked me off. I'd wait until somebody came on, I'd recite the story, and \\\"Oh, just a minute. You must tell somebody else.\\\" I mean, there was something clearly odd about what was going on there. They were answering the phone in a hurry, and I understand now they were completely overwhelmed at the time.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI was asked for a third time to tell somebody else my story, and I just laid down the law. I said, \\\"No. I have given you the details. Here they are one more time,\\\" and I wouldn't let that person off the phone. I said, \\\"I'm gonna tell you this once, and then I'm hanging up.\\\" I went through the details about the 44\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, man on the ground, need a medic, need a stretcher, goodbye.\\\" I put down the phone. I don't feel badly about that but it was a strange, strange event in the midst of this whole story. We were probably in that conference room for four minutes I would think, and then it was back to the stairs.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe ground floor\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, bear in mind we had no idea that the building was about to fall. We were taking our time. In fact, I said to Stanley at one point, \\\"Hey, let's not go too fast here. I'd hate to break an ankle and have to walk 30 floors or something.\\\" So we took our time getting down. We went all the way down, again with nobody on the stairs, not firemen coming up, nobody else evacuating. So all the way down to the Plaza level. We came out by what's known as the \\\"half-price ticket booth,\\\" where they sold theater tickets for half price. This was on the north side of the South Tower facing the Plaza.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tIt looked like it had been deserted for 100 years, and we had just discovered it.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe came out and stared, awestruck. What we looked at was normally a flowing fountain, vendors with their wagons, business people coming to and from the building, tourists everywhere. It was a beautiful people place, yet this area, several acres I'm sure, was dead; it was a moonscape. It looked like it had been deserted for 100 years, and we had just discovered it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tIt was surreal, the whole thing was surreal. We stared at it for 20 or 30 seconds with our jaws dropped, saying, \\\"What is happening here, this is very strange.\\\" We went down an escalator that wasn't working—all electricity was off, other than the emergency electricity, I guess, in the stairway—and through some revolving doors, because the women at the bottom of the escalator said to us, \\\"If you're gonna leave the building you have to go this way, through there, and go down to the Victoria Secret shop, turn right, and exit by the Sam Goody store.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe knew where that was, so we walked very casually down that hallway, down the second hallway, and we were passing firemen and policemen who were going about their business, walking normal speeds. I didn't sense there was panic. It looked like they were under control, doing their job. There were other evacuees like Stanley and me, but there was no running or crowds. It was more or less deserted.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe street\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe got out to the south exit of Four World Trade Center on the southeast corner of the complex. Firemen and policemen stood at the door. One said, \\\"Whoa, wait a minute fellows, if you are gonna cross Liberty Street, you had better go for it. There is debris falling from above.\\\" I recall saying, \\\"Should I look up?\\\" He said, \\\"Well, I wouldn't. Just go for it.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI couldn't make myself do that. I crept out under the eaves, and I cautioned a look up this way and that way, and I said, \\\"All right, Stanley, I don't see anything coming. Are you ready?\\\" He said, \\\"Yup,\\\" and after one more check, I said, \\\"All right, let's go,\\\" and we ran across Liberty Street, which is quite wide at that point, several lanes. There was nobody there. It was very much like a demilitarized zone. There was no traffic. There were some emergency vehicles around but certainly no movement and really not very many people; people were noticeably absent.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThat's when Stanley broke down. He cried to these ministers, 'o we started down that stairway. We only went three floors. There was a group of seven of us, myself and six others. I remember some of the names. Now, I know everybody at Euro Brokers, but in my mind somehow I blanked out who those other grey shapes were; they were farther up the stairs a bit, not in the light of the flashlight. I do remember Bobby Coll, Kevin York, David Vera, and Ron DiFrancesco.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe met two people that had come up from the 80\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, a heavy-set woman and by comparison a rather frail male companion of hers, a workmate. She was saying from the landing below, \\\"Stop, stop you've got to go up,\\\" and she labored up to join us, moving very slowly; she was such a big woman. She said, \\\"You've got to go up. You can't go down. There is too much smoke and flames below.\\\" I had my flashlight, and I was shining it in each face as people made comments, and an argument ensued as to what we should do.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe rescue\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt the same moment as this argument was going on I heard \\u003cem\\u003ebang, bang, bang, thump, thump, thump,\\u003c/em\\u003e \\\"Help! Help! I'm buried. I can't breathe. Is anybody there? Can you help me?,\\\" a strange voice coming from within the 81\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor. I heard this voice, and it caused me to lose concentration in this argument that was going on about whether to head up or down. I grabbed Ron by the sleeve, and I said \\\"Come on, Ron. Let's get this fellow.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThe fire escape door had blown away from the wall a bit, but we were able to push the dry wall back and step between the door frame and the dry wall, squeeze onto the 81\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor, which was in darkness, but again I had my flashlight. I scanned the room, and I said, \\\"Who's there? Where are you?\\\" He said, \\\"Oh, I can see your light.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWhat my light beam was showing me was similar to being on a very foggy road at night, because it was white dust everywhere. He said, \\\"No, to the right ... to the left ...\\\" In about a minute, Ron and I located his voice. He said, \\\"Can you see my hand?\\\" His hand was sticking out of the wall, or not the wall but this area where he was covered and blocked by some debris. He was waving his hand frantically, and my light picked up his hand. I said, \\\"Okay, see you now.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAnd at that moment my associate Ron who came down with me was overcome with smoke. He had a gym bag or a briefcase with him, and he was sort of putting it in front of his face in an attempt to filter the air. It clearly wasn't working, and Ron, with eyes shut, backed off the floor. He was almost completely overcome by the smoke.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAgain, miraculously, I was in a bubble. I was breathing fine. I was squinting a bit, but I could work, and I struggled to get debris away from Stanley—I found out later his name was Stanley Praimnath; he worked at Fuji Bank.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe got to the point I couldn't do any more work from my side, and I said, \\\"You've got to jump. You've got to get over this last barrier.\\\" Well, he jumped once and fell back down. I said, \\\"Come on, you've got to do this. It's the only way out.\\\" I reached in again, and Stanley jumped, and I got him by the collar or the shoulder or somewhere there. He said later that I just pulled him up like Superman. I don't remember having this extraordinary strength, but he says it really did happen that way. I pulled him out and onto me, and we fell in a heap and embraced. It was an exciting moment, it really was.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t'lding Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAnd they went through the whole story again. So this was reinforcement that there was no need to evacuate. I am strictly guessing but I would think we were perhaps down to about 25 people left on our floor at the time of the announcement. (I had gone for a walk through our office.) Now, as I say, the pressure was off, and there wasn't a panic, although we were greatly concerned about what was going on in Tower One.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tIf you went to the north wall windows, you could look up and see the flames and the smoke and regrettably people now starting to jump, because of heat, smoke, or whatever it was. I'm only telling this secondhand because I personally could not take myself to the window to view that. I just didn't want that image burned in my brain, and I'm forever grateful that I didn't go and take in that sight.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tOne girl in particular—Susan her name was—turned from the window when she noticed the first person (for her) jump. She hadn't noticed it before, and she spun around in tears almost frantically, ran to me, and said \\\"Oh, Brian, it's terrible. People are dying.\\\" I said, \\\"Susan, it's a terrible tragedy,\\\" and I put my arms around her, and I said \\\"Come on, let's get you more composed,\\\" and we walked out of the trading floor down the hall. In the building the center core was crossed hallways. There was a north-south hallway and an east-west hallway. I walked with her from the east side through the center core to the west side, where the ladies room was, and she went into the ladies room. (Regrettably, Susan did not survive the eventual collapse of the building.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe second plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI continued on to the west side near my office. I was fairly near the windows talking with two or three people, including especially Bobby Coll. I was looking him in the eye having a conversation with him when at apparently 9:03—I didn't check my watch—the second plane hit the south side of our building at approximately the 78\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e, 79\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e, and 80\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floors. Our room fell apart at that moment, a complete destruction without an explosion—very strange things. The lights went out, but we were near the window so there was daylight. Again, there was this sort of \\u003cem\\u003ethump\\u003c/em\\u003e, this explosion without fire and flame, a very strange sensation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI just felt in my heart, \\u003cem\\u003eOh my gosh, we are going over.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was a twist, if you like, to the building when it got hit, and therefore the plane's hitting explained some things to me later, like why the ceiling fell apart. The ceiling tiles and some of the brackets and so on fell; some air conditioning ducts, speakers, cables, and things like that that were in the ceiling fell. I seem to have a sense that some of the floor tiles even buckled a bit or were moved. Some of the walls, I recall vaguely, were actually torn in a jagged direction rather than up and down. Again perhaps explained by the torque, some of the door frames popped out of the wall and partially fell or fully fell.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFor seven to 10 seconds there was this enormous sway in the building. It was one way, and I just felt in my heart, Oh my gosh, we are going over. That's what it felt like. Now, on windy days prior to that there was a little bit of a sway to the building. You got used to it; you didn't notice it. The window blinds would go \\u003cem\\u003eclack clack\\u003c/em\\u003e as they swung. As I said, for a good seven to ten seconds I thought it was over—horrible feeling—but then the building righted itself. It didn't sway back and forth; it just went one way, it seemed, and then back, and we were stable again.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI was looking at Bobby Coll square in the eyes, and we knew in an instant that it was terrorism. I mean, there wasn't for sure terrorism on people's minds when the first building had been hit. Was it pilot error? Was it instrument error? Or just a one-off suicide? Horrible as it was, you didn't know for certain that it was terrorism. But when the second building got hit you instantly calculated the two of them: terrorism.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe evacuation\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tSo we knew we were in a difficult situation at that point in time. I fortunately had a flashlight with me, and I'm glad I did. I switched it on, and we started out of the room. Our room was not black with smoke but sort of white with chalky construction dust. It was incredibly dusty and dirty as we made our way out of the room and over some debris that had fallen from the ceiling and so on past the ladies room where I had taken Susan maybe 10 minutes earlier, and we went to this center core, this crossroads in the middle of the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt that point, had we gone three or four yards straight ahead to the east, we would have come to Stairway B. I have no idea what condition it was in because we didn't know what had happened, we didn't know where this plane had hit, we didn't know if it was a plane, we didn't know anything other than suddenly we were in chaos and our building had been hit. I could have turned right three yards to Stairway C, closer to the impact point. I had no idea what condition that stairway was in. Miraculously, at random I turned left to Stairway A, which on the floor plate is the farthest from where the impact really was.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t'\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"Brian Clark\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"268\\\" width=\\\"215\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/twin-towers-survivor-story-01.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eBrian Clark in his office on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor of the South Tower, about a year before the attack\\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003eCourtesy Brian Clark\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tLike any normal day I arrived at about 7:15 in the morning. That particular day was more or less flawless weather—beautiful day, blue sky. I don't remember the temperature, but we had an unseasonably warm fall, and I'm assuming that that day was equally pleasant.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI have been at Euro Brokers for over 29 years now. I started as a trainee broker in 1973, and for the last 14 or 15 years I've been in management. Most recently my title's been Executive Vice President. I've been one of several people who manage the company. One minor responsibility I had that turned out to be significant that day, however, was I was one of about eight or 10 people that had volunteered to be a fire marshal.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe first plane\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAs I said, I arrived about 7:15 and got my morning coffee. I went about my normal chores. I don't really recall any extraordinary events that morning until 8:46 and change, when, sitting with my back to the west wall—I had a private office, with my desk facing my door and my back to the window—I heard an enormous \\u003cem\\u003ethump.\\u003c/em\\u003e I didn't feel any vibration, but there was a noticeable sound like a \\u003cem\\u003eboom\\u003c/em\\u003e or \\u003cem\\u003ethump,\\u003c/em\\u003e and the lights buzzed for a second. My eyes jerked up to look at my overhead lights.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThe entire airspace behind me was filled with flame.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThere was suddenly this glare, and my attention was immediately caught. I spun my head around, and the entire airspace behind me was filled with flame. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it was the fuel from the first jet hitting the North Tower that had gone right through that tower and out over the airspace, south of Tower One, the North Tower. That same airspace was west of the South Tower, the tower I was in on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tMy immediate thought was there had been an explosion one or two floors above our office. That's what I thought had happened in that first instant. Being one of the fire marshals, I was equipped with a whistle and flashlight in my office. I jumped up, grabbed them, put the whistle around my neck, and more or less yelled, \\\"Get out! Everybody get out!\\\" This all took me five seconds. When I looked behind me out the window, the flames were all gone, and thousands of papers were just fluttering in the air, the edges of which were all on fire. It was like flaming confetti. Very strange.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI should have realized but didn't realize at the time that the area that all this was happening in was so huge. But I still wasn't computing that in my mind; still it was two floors up in my mind. So I ran out of my office, just a yard or two into an area where some accountants sit, and other people in offices, and I said, \\\"Come on, let's go, there has been an explosion,\\\" and I started to get people off the floor.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, we are a trading operation. Our customers are not individuals, but large financial trading institutions around the world, like a Barclay's Bank or the Royal Bank of Canada. So we have in our trading floor many television sets tuned to financial news information. Well, all of these stations cut away to their news departments, and there were these breaking news stories that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. The story developed literally within minutes, and we understood fairly soon, I would say within three or four minutes, that an airliner had hit One World Trade Center. At least that's my recollection of the timeframe.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWell, we knew now that the damage had been done to Tower One, not our Tower, so we relaxed a little bit about evacuation. Nonetheless, many people in the first minute had bolted for the stairs and were on their way down. Good news in retrospect, but at the time it was like, Oh boy, I guess we don't have to leave. The TV sets were telling us, and now there were photographs of One World Trade Center and the smoke coming out of the upper floors, I think the 92\\u003csup\\u003end\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and above. The fire marshals like myself were content to let people go or stay. Really, in a way, it didn't matter.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI called my wife and told her, \\\"You know, you won't believe this but Tower One has been hit. We are fine where we are. Relax, turn on the TV, there is a developing story there, find out what's happening.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe announcement\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAt about five minutes to nine there was an announcement by the Port Authority within our building. First the strobe lights flashed, as they did during their normal fire drills. The alarm system gave a little bit of a \\u003cem\\u003ewhoop whoop\\u003c/em\\u003e, you know, to alert you to an announcement about to be made. Then the very familiar voice, the one we heard all the time, came over the system and said, \\\"Building Two is secure. There is no need to evacuate Building Two. If you are in the midst of evacuation, you may return to your office by using the re-entry doors on the re-entry floors and the elevators to return to your office. Repeat, Building Two is secure....\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\t's man saved my life.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAcross the road you could see some people standing in doorways protecting themselves from anything that might have been falling. We ran across the street, past the fire hall, which is on the corner, and up another block and caught our breath. There was a deli owner there. I said, \\\"Have you got any water?\\\" He went in and just handed us this water in bottles and said, \\\"Here you go.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\" He said, \\\"In fact, here is a breakfast platter. I don't think anybody is going to be picking that up.\\\" And he gave me this great tray with some fresh fruit on it and some sweet rolls. He was a very generous fellow at the time considering the conditions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI carried this with me another block to the west side of Trinity Church, where we met a couple of ministers. That's when Stanley broke down. He cried to these ministers, \\\"This man saved my life.\\\" He completely broke down. I was overcome with emotion as well, and I said, \\\"You know, Stanley, you may think I saved your life but I think you saved my life, too. You got me out of that argument as to whether I should go up or go down. I'm here, and I'm fine, and it's because of your voice in the darkness that I made it.\\\" We embraced, and the ministers had a quick prayer, and one of them said, \\\"You know, the church is open if you would like to go in there.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe collapse\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tStanley and I looked at each other, and we nodded and said, \\\"All right, let's do that.\\\" So we walked to the south side of Trinity Church, which is a street that slopes up. As we walked up it we got higher and higher, and with the wall in relation to us going lower, we could now turn around and see the World Trade Center. We grabbed onto the fence railing of the cemetery and looked through the grate up at the Trade Center, and Stanley said to me, \\\"You know, I think those buildings could go down.\\\" I said, \\\"There is no way. Those are steel structures. That's furniture and paper and carpeting and draperies and things like that that are burning.\\\" But I didn't finish the sentence when Tower Two started to slide down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI would say that we'd been out of the building maybe five minutes when the building collapsed. It disappeared into its own dust. What I thought had happened at that instant was only the top third or quarter of the building down to the fire line had collapsed. It was a horrible feeling. I mean, our whole escape was horrible when it was happening, but you at least thought people had a chance—until that moment. Then I knew that certainly in the top quarter of the tower there was no chance. We just stared at it in awe, not realizing what was happening completely.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stared, watching, with nobody running or anything initially. But then this great tsunami of dust came over the church. Everybody looked up, and, as in a disaster movie, everybody started running in fear of the debris and dust that might be in there. But I knew there was nothing solid that was going to harm me, that the building hadn't fallen over. I knew that. But you didn't want to breathe the junk that was in there, so we ran down Broadway to 42 Broadway. We went into that building as the dust and smoke was catching up to our backsides. We got into that lobby with many other people, strangers doing the same thing. The air was clean in there, and people were milling around.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tI yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI realized then that I was still carrying the silly fruit platter, so I plumped that down on the reception desk there, and people started digging into it. It was an odd thing that I didn't just chuck it aside when I was running. I wasn't even aware that I was carrying it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe stayed for at least half an hour, I suppose. The ash settled. We went out the east side of that building, which was onto New Street. It was like a winter's day, grey sky. I suppose it was a quarter of an inch of dust and ash everywhere, but it looked like freshly fallen fine snow. We walked in amazement down the street. I was still thinking, of course, that only the top part of the tower had slid off or slid into itself or something like that. No cell phones, no land lines were working. There was no way to communicate with anybody by telephone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe wandered over to the east side of Manhattan, the East River. Stanley gave me his business card, and thank goodness he did, because in the crowd that was walking, he and I suddenly got parted. He just disappeared into the crowd. I yelled and looked and walked back and forth but he was gone. I was very grateful I had his business card at that point, because I knew that he was real. My initial thought was, Whoa, this was an angel; this didn't happen. It was a strange feeling that slipped over me. But, hey, I had his business card, so I knew he was real.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe ferry\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI wandered up FDR Drive on the east side of the island, thinking I was going to have to walk to mid-town to somehow get home to northern New Jersey where I live. But in this fog, in this white, wintry day, I heard someone on a bullhorn, \\\"Next ferry for Jersey City.\\\" That's strange, I thought. I didn't even know there were ferries over here. Well, what the ferry company had done was reroute their ferries to the east side of the island; there's a pier over there, Pier 11. I thought, This is wonderful.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI jumped on that ferry. They certainly weren't charging. We sailed around the southern tip of Manhattan, up the Hudson River, and as we got parallel to the World Trade Center—the wind was blowing from north to south that day—it was then that I and many other people realized for the first time that both towers were completely down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tThis building I had worked in for 27 years was gone.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI also realized that the first hint that I'd had of the second tower, that is, Tower One, coming down was when I had gotten on that ferry 15 minutes earlier, because a black cloud had enveloped the boat as I was getting on it. It was noticeable that with the South Tower, the one that fell first, the ensuing ash was white and grey, whereas with the second tower that fell, the North Tower, it was black. Now, if that was because it burned longer or what I don't know, but it was a noticeable difference.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tBut as we got parallel we could look over and see that both towers were gone. It was just a surreal feeling. Disbelief. How could this happen? Of course, at the time we knew nothing about the planes being hijacked, nothing about the Pentagon, nothing about the plane going down in Pennsylvania, or the FAA getting all planes out of the air. We were completely in the dark. But we could look off to the Trade Center on our right and see that this building I had worked in for 27 years was gone. It was a staggering thought. There was silence. People just couldn't believe it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe homecoming\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tWe sailed in silence to Harborside in Jersey City and got off the ferry. Well, I ran to the ticket booth. I think I was the first person there. I asked the lady if I could use the phone, and she said, \\\"Absolutely.\\\" I called my wife, and I could hear the cheers back at home. This is now about 11:15, I think, and my building came down sometime around 10 a.m. The last time I had talked to my wife was at about 20 to 10, so for over an hour and a half she had no idea where I was. Certainly for an hour and 15 minutes she had seen the tower down and was quite beside herself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tFortunately, the house was full of people. My wife, Dianne, had some neighbors there, members of our church, our minister. My older son, his wife and three children were there, along with my older daughter and my younger son and his fiancé. My youngest daughter is at school in Toronto, so she wasn't there, but it was a house full of people. So when I called, there was a great cheer of relief and just agony relieved.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThey wanted to come and get me. I said, \\\"Well, look, I know the traffic in the area will be horrible.\\\" So I ended up, with hundreds of other people, walking about a mile north. I was pretty tired at this point, but I walked that mile to the Hoboken train terminal. As I walked into the terminal at five to noon, there was an announcement that the 11:30 train, which had been delayed, would be leaving in five minutes. \\\"All aboard for such and such a station,\\\" which was the station I needed to go to. So there was another bit of luck. I got on the train, and it left five minutes later.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI rode all the way to my station, got in my car, and drove the next 15 minutes to my home. When I hit the driveway, I honked the horn awfully loudly many times. There was then a front lawn full of tears and a reunion, and then for days the telephone didn't stop ringing. It was friends from all over the world, media, widows. (You know, we wouldn't call them widows at the time; their husbands were missing.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tNow, Ronnie, who I told you had gone up to the 91\\u003csup\\u003est\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor and later told me he panicked and went down, when he exited the building it was at the very time when Tower Two was starting to fall. So the moment I was watching the building from Trinity Church was exactly the moment he was coming out of the same place I did, and he was caught in an explosion. He heard the explosion, swirled around, and a fireball was rushing at him from right at the doors where he was about to leave the building.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\tWe lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe put his hands up in front of his face and got blown many, many yards across Liberty Street, which I'd run across earlier. He was severely burned in the arm, he had head wounds, cracked vertebrae. He doesn't remember really what happened right after that, but he ended up at St. Vincent's Hospital. They called his wife and told her he was fine, but she was unable to get to him for a couple of days because all the routes and tunnels were closed; they weren't allowing access back into Manhattan.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tHe didn't remember much those first several days, but he is now back at work on a part-time basis recovering and doing a great job. He's one of the heroes in my mind, because of that determination to get out.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tThat's my story. It was a long, horrific day, but for me it turned out all right. For many others, I'm deeply saddened that they aren't here. We lost 61 people in total, some of whom I think were either caught in elevators coming back to the office or had come back to the office. We'll never know for sure whether it was a wingtip and flames that caused their demise right on the 84\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e floor in the east side of the building, where a lot of our traders were, or whether it was smoke when they went higher, or whether it was the collapse of the building. Nonetheless, as I say, we lost 61 friends—dear friends that we worked with and laughed with for years.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\ns man saved my life.'\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tAcross the road you could see some people standing in doorways protecting themselves from anything that might have been falling. We ran across the street, past the fire hall, which is on the corner, and up another block and caught our breath. There was a deli owner there. I said, \\\"Have you got any water?\\\" He went in and just handed us this water in bottles and said, \\\"Here you go.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\" He said, \\\"In fact, here is a breakfast platter. I don't think anybody is going to be picking that up.\\\" And he gave me this great tray with some fresh fruit on it and some sweet rolls. He was a very generous fellow at the time considering the conditions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI carried this with me another block to the west side of Trinity Church, where we met a couple of ministers. That's when Stanley broke down. He cried to these ministers, \\\"This man saved my life.\\\" He completely broke down. I was overcome with emotion as well, and I said, \\\"You know, Stanley, you may think I saved your life but I think you saved my life, too. You got me out of that argument as to whether I should go up or go down. I'm here, and I'm fine, and it's because of your voice in the darkness that I made it.\\\" We embraced, and the ministers had a quick prayer, and one of them said, \\\"You know, the church is open if you would like to go in there.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\n\\tThe collapse\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tStanley and I looked at each other, and we nodded and said, \\\"All right, let's do that.\\\" So we walked to the south side of Trinity Church, which is a street that slopes up. As we walked up it we got higher and higher, and with the wall in relation to us going lower, we could now turn around and see the World Trade Center. We grabbed onto the fence railing of the cemetery and looked through the grate up at the Trade Center, and Stanley said to me, \\\"You know, I think those buildings could go down.\\\" I said, \\\"There is no way. Those are steel structures. That's furniture and paper and carpeting and draperies and things like that that are burning.\\\" But I didn't finish the sentence when Tower Two started to slide down.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\tI would say that we'd been out of the building maybe five minutes when the building collapsed.

Many scientists believe that global warming driven by the burning of fossil fuels is primarily responsible for the rise in global sea level, which at Venice has resulted in higher and more frequent instances of acqua alta. To make matters worse, Venice has been sinking over the centuries, due to the natural settling of lagoon sediments and the indiscriminate pumping of freshwater from a deep aquifer beneath the city.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tSixteen hundred years ago, around the time of Venice's founding, the Adriatic's standard sea level was almost six feet below what it is today. For a millennium and a half, Venetians were able to cope with the problems associated with living in a water-dominated environment. As late as 1900, for example, water at extreme high tide covered St. Mark's Square only seven times a year.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\tBoats cannot navigate the canals during the highest tides because they cannot pass under bridges.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tBy 1989, however, such inundation occurred no fewer than 40 times a year.

When storms with strong winds roam northeasterly across Italy and Adriatic tides run high, engineers would activate a system that pumped compressed air into the gates. The air would force out the water, enabling the gates to rise on hinges and form a barrier against the surging seas.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tProject MOSE, the acronym for the experimental model created to test the gates' performance (\\u003cem\\u003eModulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico\\u003c/em\\u003e), has been the only proposal proffered by engineers, contractors, and consortium scientists since the early 1970s.

Supporters of the project said design work would begin this fall (2002), with construction getting under way within a few years. The most ardent supporters said they believed the gates would be in operation between 2007 and 2010. On September 23, 2002, however, the Venice City Council voted to reconsider its support for the gates and raised the specter that the project should be reevaluated. This was stunning news, and whether the project will ever regain its standing remains in doubt.*\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\tIt is political reality in Italy that governments do not last long; 58 governments have come and gone since 1945.\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tThe project has long had a bevy of critics: Italian and international environmentalists, along with scientists who for three decades have disapprovingly followed the path to the MOSE solution. Those opposed believe that relentlessly rising seas will make MOSE obsolete within a few years. They also worry that officials would need to raise the gates so often that the normal ebb and flow of the cleansing tides would dramatically affect aquatic life within the lagoon and make the city unlivable for long periods, as sewage normally flushed from the lagoon remains behind. These critics want more studies conducted on the gates' potential environmental impact, and they want the international scientific and engineering community to come up with new solutions that would protect Venice for the next century rather than for just the next few decades.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tEven if gates advocates can somehow reverse the stance of the Venice City Council, the national government faces many other hurdles before it could ever consider construction. First is the question of financing the project. The current Italian government, in power since early 2001, has also announced plans to rebuild the nation's freeway system, expand the national high-speed train system, and construct a suspension bridge from the Italian mainland to Sicily. All this comes at a time of budget crisis and no identifiable means of raising the billions of euros needed to launch these projects.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tItalians tend to wink at such grandiose pronouncements.

City officials backed by the Italian government have quietly appropriated significant sums of money separate from the gates project to improve the infrastructure of the historic center.

Take hydrogen, for example. In its most common form, it has one proton and one electron. There are also two less common isotopes, deuterium and tritium, which have one and two neutrons, respectively, in addition to their proton and electron. Deuterium is particularly useful to forensic scientists. It is naturally occurring and very stable, meaning it is found in water in varying amounts, and, critically, those variations depend on the source of the water.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"carousel-mass-spectrometer\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"480\\\" width=\\\"672\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/stable-isotopes-01.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eA time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) used to analyze the stable isotope composition of surfaces.\\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003eCourtesy of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tLesley Chesson works at Salt Lake City-based IsoForensics, the company that received the hair sample. \\\"It was our first case, where we really got started,\\\" says Chesson, an analytical chemist. \\\"They contacted us to see if we would analyze the hair—a long length of the hair—looking at hydrogen and oxygen to see, Was she local? Did she move into the area? If she did, where was she from prior to her death?\\\" Such clues would give investigators valuable information as they continued to search for the victim's identity.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\nTo see how that's possible, let's follow a raindrop from a cloud over the Pacific Ocean to Saltair Sally's strand of hair. When those clouds rain, the heavier, oxygen-18 containing water molecules will fall out first. That typically happens near the coast. As the rain cloud moves inland, it's constantly losing molecules with oxygen-18, and its raindrops become isotopically lighter and lighter. Since our drinking water comes from rainwater, people near the coasts drink water with more oxygen-18 atoms in it than people living inland. Those atoms eventually become a part of our tissues, like hair. \\r\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tIf Saltair Sally had been in Salt Lake City in the weeks preceding her death, the hair closest to her scalp would reflect the isotopic signature of Salt Lake City's local water supply. If she had been in, say, Seattle instead, her hair's isotopic composition would contain more oxygen-18, giving investigators a valuable clue.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\t\\\"We analyzed the hair sample,\\\" Chesson says. \\\"It looked like within the two years leading up to her death, she had been a frequent migrant. She had moved at least three or four times, and it seemed she was making this sort of cyclic pattern. She was in a region consistent with Salt Lake City and the Intermountain West, and then she was moving someplace more towards the northwest. She did this a couple of times in the years leading up to her death.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tArmed with this new information, detectives refocused their investigation on the regions Chesson and her colleagues had suggested.

Fingernails are nearly identical in composition to hair, and like hair, they leave an isotopic timeline that remains unchanged until it gets cut off. In fact, every part of our bodies has potentially exploitable isotopic signatures. Though hydrogen and oxygen in hair and fingernails are often the first to be analyzed, other isotopes and body tissues can provide different types of information, says Wolfram Meier-Augenstein, a professor and principal scientist at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\t\\\"Very rarely is one isotope alone the thing that will solve the case,\\\" he says. \\\"It is usually a combination. Forensic science is all about context. We usually aim to build a picture not relying on one technique.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tCarbon and nitrogen are two other elements commonly used by forensic scientists. Like hydrogen and oxygen, carbon and nitrogen are found throughout our bodies. But instead of chronicling the water supply, they reflect people's diets. Carbon in our bodies is largely derived from plant tissues, which get their carbon from CO\\u003csub\\u003e2\\u003c/sub\\u003e in the atmosphere. Carbon isotopes are concentrated differently depending on which type of photosynthesis a plant uses. Wheat, rice, and sugar beets use what's known as C3 photosynthesis. Their cells take CO\\u003csub\\u003e2\\u003c/sub\\u003e directly from the atmosphere to convert to sugar. Corn, sorghum, and sugar cane use a different photosynthetic pathway known as C4, which has an additional enzyme that concentrates CO\\u003csub\\u003e2\\u003c/sub\\u003e before handing it off to Rubisco, which begins the carbon fixing process. The added step in C4 plants increases their carbon-13 levels relative to C3 plants. In North America, where corn is common in diets, people's tissues tend to have high carbon-13 concentrations.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\r\\n\\t\\\"We don't find a needle in a haystack. We reduce the haystack to a manageable size.\\\"\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tNitrogen isotope levels depend on whether people are omnivorous, vegetarian, vegan, or otherwise. Each step up the food chain enriches the ratio of nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14 by 3.4‰ (per mille). That means the tissues of a person who is vegan will have less nitrogen-15 than the tissues of someone who eats mostly meat. Such clues about a victim's diet can be helpful when police are canvassing for clues.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"tooth\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"480\\\" width=\\\"672\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/stable-isotopes-02.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eStable isotopes in teeth provide investigators with detailed records of where a person was living when they were formed.

The signature in teeth won't change at all,\\\" Meier-Augenstein says. Turnover in muscle tissue, which you might think would happen quickly, is a slow process. \\\"Depending on which muscle we would probe, it would take three to six months before everything in the soft tissue department would have changed.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\r\\n\\tChemically identical, isotopically distinct\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tAnalyzing human tissue in cases like Saltair Sally's is an obvious application of stable isotopes, but it isn't the only one. Meier-Augenstein frequently deals with drug-related cases, including one in the United Kingdom where a man was initially arrested on the street for possessing five tablets of MDMA, or ecstasy. It's a minor offense, but the police felt he might have been hiding something.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\t\\\"The police secured a search warrant and searched his place, and lo and behold, in a gym bag in a wardrobe, they found a huge plastic bag with thousands of ecstasy tablets,\\\" Meier-Augenstein recounts. The suspect denied knowledge of the stash, instead blaming it on a friend. Though the tablets looked and were chemically to similar to the five found on the suspect, police didn't feel it was enough for a solid conviction, Meier-Augenstein says. That's where stable isotopes came in. \\\"These tablets were analyzed isotopically, and lo and behold, at a 95-plus percent confidence level, there was absolutely nothing to choose between them.\\\" Confronted with this new evidence, the suspect admitted his guilt.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tDrug-related cases aren't the only type where stable isotope forensics can augment traditional chemical analysis. Today, many products are chemically identical, even if they are from separate factories. Take, for example, white paint chips found on a crime scene, Chesson says, or traces of explosives used in a terrorist attack. Evidence from the crime scene may chemically match those found in a suspect's home, but stable isotope analysis could reveal that they were made in separate factories. If that were a key piece of evidence, the isotopic analysis could be enough to keep an innocent person out of prison.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tStable isotopes can also distinguish genuine products from counterfeits. The liquor industry, which is rife with fakes and mislabeled products, has found isotopic analysis to be particularly useful. Wine may be intentionally mislabeled as a better vintage, or a cheap single-malt whiskey could be hawked as an upscale brand. By comparing a suspected counterfeit with an original sample, stable isotopes can help investigators unmask the fraud.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\r\\n\\tisotopic filters\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tThough stable isotopes are useful in sniffing out potential counterfeits—or potential leads in a case—they are not a means of identification, like fingerprints or DNA. \\\"I really don't like the word identification, because that's not what we do,\\\" Meier-Augenstein says. \\\"We try to create a picture of the person's life and life circumstance that hopefully helps jog a person's memory.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\n            \\u003cfigure class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\"\\u003e\\n            \\u003cimg alt=\\\"Autosampler\\\" class=\\\"richtext-image full-width\\\" height=\\\"480\\\" width=\\\"672\\\"\\n            src=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/stable-isotopes-03.width-800.jpg\\\"/\\u003e\\n            \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eSamples being loaded into a mass spectrometer for analysis.\\u003cdiv class=\\\"credit\\\"\\u003eCourtesy of Lesley Chesson\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n            \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tMeier-Augenstein recommends viewing each stable isotope as a filter. In our globalized world, a John Doe could have come from anywhere. Investigators start looking for clues close to where the victim was found, but if nothing turns up, they could end up combing through every missing persons list in the world.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tStable isotopes help narrow that search. Deuterium and oxygen-18 from a victim's hair or fingernails \\\"can exclude 80 or 90 percent of the world,\\\" Meier-Augenstein notes. A nitrogen-15 analysis of the victim's muscle tissue could reveal that he was a vegetarian, another useful clue. And heavier isotopes such as strontium leech from rocks into groundwater, eventually making their way into our bones and teeth.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tTogether, all of these clues narrow the field of potential matches, greatly simplifying things for detectives. \\\"We don't find a needle in a haystack,\\\" Meier-Augenstein says. \\\"What we do, in an ideal circumstance, is we reduce the haystack to a manageable size.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\r\\n\\twhat the future holds\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tWhile stable isotopes have proven themselves useful, they aren't staples of forensic science—yet. Part of the problem is cost. Stable isotope analysis isn't cheap. Preparing samples takes lots of time and involves a host of costly chemicals. Most samples today are run through mass spectrometers, which are large, expensive, and often temperamental. Finally, interpreting the data requires an expert. These obstacles aren't insurmountable, but they're not insignificant.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tTo change that, Meier-Augenstein thinks a landmark case needs to hinge on evidence provided by stable isotopes. \\\"There will be a major case, unfortunately it will involve something very unpleasant,\\\" he says. \\\"My money would probably be on terrorism, as sad as the prospect might be, or it's a high profile murder case where isotopes provide the clincher.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tChesson is more optimistic. She feels that breakthroughs in equipment used to process stable isotopes samples will spur widespread adoption. Currently she is testing a new device that uses a laser to measure isotopic ratios. It doesn't require samples to be as carefully prepared, and it doesn't take up nearly as much space as a typical mass spectrometer. Chesson foresees a day when that technology could be further miniaturized to where it can fit on countertops or even in the trunks of detectives' cruisers.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\t\\\"You could take your analyzer places that you couldn't before, which means you can analyze things that are harder to collect and get back to lab. That decreases costs, speeds up time, and opens up a whole new set of samples that you could possibly analyze,\\\" she says. \\\"Anything that decreases cost and increases throughput will always help this type of analysis. That's why DNA analysis really exploded.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003e\\r\\n\\tNaming saltair sally\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tSalt Lake Unified Police announced on August 7, 2012 that, with the help of stable isotope analysis, they had identified Saltair Sally. Her name was Nikole Bakoles. The cyclic pattern of travel between Salt Lake City and Seattle recorded in Saltair Sally's hair matched information provided in Bakoles's missing persons report, which had been filed in 2003. A DNA test confirmed the match. Bakoles, who was 20 at the time of her death, was last seen in March 2000, when she was living in a hotel in a southern suburb of Salt Lake City with her boyfriend and young child. In the preceding years, she had traveled to Seattle occasionally to visit family members, a habit which was clearly recorded in the isotopic composition of her hair. Without that information, it's likely Saltair Sally would still be a cold case.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\r\\n\\tGiven where Bakoles's remains were found and the manner in which they were disposed, police suspect foul play. Stable isotopes haven't led to an arrest yet, Chesson says, \\\"but we did help finally put a name to a person, which was really pretty cool.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n
