These are excerpts from those letters.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can’t afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals’ decisions to put significant amounts of money into Celsius, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Celsius. Celsius may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.</p>\n\n<p>All case filings can be viewed on <a href=\"https://cases.stretto.com/Celsius/court-docket/\">Stretto</a>. Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724\">on Twitter</a>, and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is looking to submit a letter of their own, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/w2x7f2/how_to_submit_a_letter_to_the_judge_and_contact/\">this Reddit post</a> seems to explain how.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>On June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they’ll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.</p>\n\n<p>Celsius offered both “Earn” and “Custody” accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and could be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but did not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"excerpts\">Excerpts</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907222280000000131.pdf\">Doc 160</a>, filed July 22, 2022:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I put all my personal savings that were sitting in a bank account for various needs.

Carpet in my house got ruined. The carpet was growing mold and making myself and family sick. So we had to replace it before we ended up in the hospital from constantly breathing in mold. I had to sell some of my retirement investments in order to pay for the carpet. Had I had the savings that I transferred to Celsius, I would not have had to dip into my retirement funds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I also had a long weekend vacation planned.

I have published similar excerpts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1550160830762782724\">on Twitter</a>, and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is looking to submit a letter of their own, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/w2x7f2/how_to_submit_a_letter_to_the_judge_and_contact/\">this Reddit post</a> seems to explain how.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>On June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they’ll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.</p>\n\n<p>Celsius offered both “Earn” and “Custody” accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and could be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but did not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"excerpts\">Excerpts</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907222280000000131.pdf\">Doc 160</a>, filed July 22, 2022:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I put all my personal savings that were sitting in a bank account for various needs.

I was only earning 3-5% on my BTC/ETH, and since ETH when it is staked to ETH2.0 earns about 6-7%, I figured it was fine. The way they (in their weekly AMA’s) explained it, was that the funds were either staked on the net with “safe” options such as ETH2.0 and MATIC.

These are excerpts from those letters.\n\nIt’s important to understand that schemes like this in the cryptocurrency industry are hurting real people who are often suffering losses they can’t afford. Regardless of what you may believe about individuals’ decisions to put significant amounts of money into Celsius, blame lies with the executives creating and running these companies and with the U.S. legal and regulatory system for allowing companies like this to operate.\n\nThe goal of highlighting these excerpts is to illustrate this, and shed some light on how people are convinced to put their money into projects like Celsius. Celsius may have been one of the first companies to collapse in the 2022 crypto crash, but it is hardly unique.\n\nAll case filings can be viewed on Stretto. Individual letters are linked alongside their excerpts. I have published similar excerpts on Twitter, and will be continuing to update that thread and this post as new letters are entered. New letters will go at the top of this post, which is in reverse order based on docket number.\n\nIf anyone is looking to submit a letter of their own, this Reddit post seems to explain how.\n\nBackground\nOn June 12, 2022, the cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius Network suspended customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers. On July 13, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Users have been unable to withdraw crypto stored in Celsius accounts. Users with loans open are still having to add collateral to maintain their loans, despite not knowing if they’ll be able to retrieve their collateral. Some have been forcibly liquidated even though they intended to add collateral to open loans, due to needing to go through the overloaded Celsius support team.\n\nCelsius offered both “Earn” and “Custody” accounts. With Earn accounts, users received a percentage rate of return either in the $CEL token or in the same tokens they were holding. In April 2022, Celsius stopped allowing non-accredited investors in the United States to keep Earn accounts, in order to comply with U.S. regulations. With Custody accounts, coins are stored and could be transferred, swapped, or used for loan collateral, but did not accumulate the rewards of the Earn accounts.\n\nExcerpts\n\nDoc 160, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I put all my personal savings that were sitting in a bank account for various needs. Including purchasing a car in the very near future, maintaining my home, vacation savings, and extra funds for unexpected events.\n\n\n\n  Well I had an unexpected event. Carpet in my house got ruined. The carpet was growing mold and making myself and family sick. So we had to replace it before we ended up in the hospital from constantly breathing in mold. I had to sell some of my retirement investments in order to pay for the carpet. Had I had the savings that I transferred to Celsius, I would not have had to dip into my retirement funds.\n\n\n\n  I also had a long weekend vacation planned. I was going to use my savings to pay for it. Again I had to sell retirement investments to pay for the vacation.\n\n\n\n  I also sold $50,000 from my retirement investments and put them into Celsius. It took me years and years to save that money. Not sure if Ill ever get that back.\n\n\n\n  At the time of this letter I have over $99,000 with Celsius. $50,000 being from retirement and $49,000 being my personal savings.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 159, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have approx. 7,000 worth of assets stuck on Celsius. To some that may not be much. To others like myself, it is a huge part of my investment. You may be thinking that I deserve this and I’ve should have gotten out before Celsius paused withdrawals. Maybe so. But I hope there is a part of you that sees many people losing out on their investments/life savings. It’s a real shame that this happened to people who like myself are just trying to improve their quality of life by increasing their net worth.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 158, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I’m from Brazil and I have 0.1 BTC [~$2,300 on date of filing] on my earn account. I know it can be considered a low amount when compared to other users, but for me it is a significant amount.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 157, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a single mother of 2 daughters who are going to college next year. I have supported my parents and my daughters by myself for whole life. I am struggling hard for living.\nI saw Celsius advertisement and promotion through media and deposited my cryptos which I purchase at the top price from Coinbase Pro last December. My cryptos on the Celsius are maybe not big money for Mr. Mashinsky and his high salaried staffs ($30,000 monthly income after filing Chapter 11), but it is huge amount of money for my poor family. Like many other depositors, I and my family are severely impacted both in financial and mental health by the bankruptcy and locked up cryptos. I always check the app if my cryptos are still there. I can’t focus my job or sleep.\nI deposited my cryptos on the Celsius because they always claim that Celsius is SAFER than traditional banks or even other Crypto companies through the medias.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 156, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  This has an immense impact on my life and finances as I have almost $43,000 frozen in my account without the ability to access. Like many others, I am very close to retirement and based on information shared, felt that this was a very good platform.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 155, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I, like many others, have my 6 six figure life savings currently trapped within Celsius Network. I made the decision to move my cryptocurrency which I have been slowly building up since 2017 to Celsius Network due to my understanding that they were providing loans that were over-collateralized to individuals and institutions.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 154, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have—at this time–$120,000.00-worth of hard-earned funds in Celsius…\n\n\n\n  The amount of Crypto that I’ve entrusted to these criminals represents a massive portion of my entire savings. A portion of this Crypto was purchased with money earned from 20-year EE Bonds that I purchased every month while I served as a Rifleman (0311) in the USMC, from which my discharge was Honorable. … The funds that I’ve invested have taken a lifetime to raise. Life will be hard without these funds, even if there are no emergencies. If there is an emergency, then there is simply no way that I could stand against it without these funds; it is crucial that they are returned to me.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 153, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  Even worst I convinced my wife to take her money from her bank and converted into usdc to deposit into Celsius, now she has 12.000 Euros in Celsius account. Since I started to buy Bitcoin in 2018, I saved every euro from my salary to invest in a future where I could feel safe and protect my family, now I feel that lost all after they canceled withdrawals and I want to die, my life has become a complete mess, a lot of depression and I have one month not sleeping and feeling miserable due Celsius.\n\n\n\n  I have right now 1,80 BTC [~$42,000 on date of filing] in Celsius and that’s the money I’m planning to give to my daughter when I pass away, please help us many people is suffering due Alex.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 152, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I wanted you to know that I have my life savings held up in a Celsius Network account. The impact of not being able to withdraw my deposits has left my family in limbo and uncertainty of what the future holds for us financially.\nThe filing of bankruptcy by Celsius Network LLC has added a lot of stress to me and my family. Depending on the outcome, we will need to delay our retirement plans and continue to be in the work force instead of enjoying our retirement. We will be forced to make up for the deposits we will potentially lose.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 149, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a depositor with Celsius and I currently have 7.1599751 BTC (Bitcoin) [~$73,000 on date of filing] + 54.666429 ETH (Ethereum) [~$86,000 on date of filing] locked on the platform, some of which is being used as collateral on various loans. I have already been liquidated on 4 of those loans as it was not possible to pay off the loan (which I had the money to do so) due to the locked status that Celsius imposed on it’s customers.\n\n\n\n  This accounts for almost all of my life savings which I invested in over a year ago and placed in my Celsius account earlier this year before the company collapsed. This is my life savings from more than 10 years of hard work and I cannot tell you how distressed and lost I am about what to do.\n\n\n\n  Some of this collateral was also funds that my family asked me to invest for them and I cannot bring myself to tell them what’s happened and am extremely depressed and have basically shut down mentally and cannot work or see friends due to this deep depression. I will never recover from this financial loss.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 148, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  If I were to never get my funds back I would recover, it would take time and some of the life goals I have would be set back further than I would like. But many people would be taking such a devasting blow that recovering would, at least seem, almost impossible. To build homes. To start families. To invest in businesses. To escape debt. To feed themselves. The list of possibilities better than allowing these crooks to get away with customer funds is infinite.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 147, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  Like many others, I had savings deposited into Celsius Network. I believe the total amount was about $5000 when Celsius froze all withdrawals. This may not be a lot of money to some but it is a lot of money to me and I worked hard to obtain it. I trusted Celsius Network with my savings as they advertised I could withdraw my money at all times. This wasn’t actually the case.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 146, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I personally have 1.67+ BTC [~$39,000 on date of filing] and 83.9+ ETH [~$128,000 on date of filing] being held by Celsius. I am a retired school teacher and funds of that magnitude are highly significant to me.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 145, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  Currently I have my entire life savings & retirement invested in Celsius in the stable coin USDC in the amount of $205,001.66 I cannot begin to tell you the level of devastation and horror I felt when Celsius froze withdrawals.\n\n\n\n  Having my funds frozen has been devastating to me and my family both financially, mentally, and physically. I cannot sleep most nights and am over-whelmed with worry and dread for my family’s future. I have two small children. A 3-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. I am the sole bread winner for my family, and I pride myself on making smart financial and parental decisions for them to provide a better life and a bright/positive future.\n\n\n\n  I was going to be using my funds to finish building my home and complete the construction of my property that has already been underway for over 1 year. I am currently left scrambling trying to figure out ways to get myself out of this mess that Celsius has put me in.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 144, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  My wife and I are Celsius customers who have approximately $140,000 locked on Celsius…. Many lives have been destroyed by Celsius.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 143, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I have well over $1,300,000 in this custody account which was worth almost $2,700,000 less than 12 months ago. I chose to move it into the custody account under the assumption that it was safe due to the well-understood definition of a “custodian” as well as Celsius’s own terms and conditions…\n\n\n\n\nDoc 142, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a hardworking middle class husband and  father who is struggling to make ends meet, every single week. At the moment, I have under  $1,000 in my Wells Fargo checking account, which, as a result of the freeze, is my only source  of funds to provide for my family. I live in California, where everything is egregiously expensive,  and there is absolutely no way that I can continue to provide without access to my assets at  Celsius. I request an immediate release of my funds under several pretenses, the first and  foremost reason being that this is an EMERGENCY situation, simply to keep a roof over  my family and food on their table.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 140, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  Thousands of everyday hard-working people and families stand to lose more than they can recover in their lifetime, while Alex Mashinsky, the CEO of Celsius will walk away a wealthier businessman. This is not justice. This is not right.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 138, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I, myself, have a little over $20,000 in stable coins frozen in Celsius’ earn program. Not having access to that amount of money is devastating because I worked hard to save that up and could be using that money to pay off debt or bills in a time when prices, and inflation, are running rampant.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 137, filed July 22, 2022:\n\n\n  I am the mother of [redacted] who filed claim. As she mentioned she is a single mother of 2 daughters, and she has supported me and my husband for whole her life. She is struggling hard for living.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 136, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am writing to you today as one of the thousands of unsecured creditors in the Celsius case who listened to the promises of Alex Mashinsky and transferred my entire retirement and life savings into Celsius in order to receive yield. I did this because I was led to believe that this was a safe alternative to a bank savings account. Alex Mashinsky told us, whereas banks charge customers up to 29.9% interest on credit card debt using customer money and keep all of it for themselves, with Celsius we share the interest with you and eliminate the risk…\n\n\n\n  It was devastating to learn, when withdrawals were stopped on June 12th and the truth started to come out, that they took my carefully accumulated life savings, part of which were the proceeds from the family home I had just sold in late 2020 in preparation for a downsized retirement, and recklessly exposed them to enormous risk, mismanagement and loss.\n\n\n\n  Today, not many months from retirement, I face financial ruin and a very bleak future if those funds are not made whole to me again and in kind. I divided my investment between a US dollar stable coin USDC to earn high yield now to live on; and some pristine cryptos that have an incredible upside potential, in the next five to ten years, to grow to several million dollars to keep me in my old age and to pass on to my children.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 135, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  As a personal plea, in which I am echoed by numerous depositors. I am a retail investor with a good portion of my life savings on the platform. I put my crypto assets as well as a good portion of my bank savings in Celsius relying on the fraudulent  assertions of the Celsius executive management team, who attested repeatedly that our interest payments were based on  over-collateralized loans with delta neutral risk. I also recommended this platform to friends, who are now also in the same  situation.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 132, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I (58 years old) saved hard for my pension gap that I have in order to bridge two years financially without any worries. before I start receiving state pension and old age pension. Now that has become very insecure and you are my (our) savior so as not to end up in a financial hole later. I will soon need my money to be able to eat and live.\n\n\n\n  My wife … (56 years old) has also opened a Celsius account on my advice and she has largely deposited her savings into it. My 80-year-old mother … also opened an account through me because the interest on the bank in the Netherlands has become 0% and she can continue to pay her bills carefree. After seeing another AMA of Alex M, the last one, was also where he said; open an account with us, it’s safe, you can win $1000 bonus!!! Finally, on June 11, 2022, my 23-year-old son opened an account and deposited his piece of bitcoin into it and a week later everything was locked. He was shocked and angry with me and said because of you I am now in this misery.\n\n\n\n  Judge Glenn, I could cry and feel very guilty for advising my family to Celsius. In retrospect it sounded too good to be true, we say in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 131, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  On May 27th, 2022, after viewing several recent videos of Alex Mashinsky promising that my crypto assets would be safe and that I would receive 6.50% APY on my BTC and 6.00% APY on my ETH, I transferred 0.868842 BTC [~$25,400 on date of deposit] & 11.670072 ETH [~$21,000 on date of deposit] onto the Celsius Network. I was also promised $550 in 30 to 90 days as a promotion to entice me to transfer my assets to Celsius. I found that after I transferred my crypto assets that the actual APY quoted was only on a small portion of my holdings. Still, the actual APY was about the same as I was receiving else ware, so I decided to stay with Celsius to receive the promotional rewards. Just 16 days later, and after receiving no APY or rewards, I was informed that I could no longer withdrawal my assets.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 129, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a Brazilian worker and I put all my money on this platform, as ALEX (CEO) said that we would be safe from the risks of banks and would offer a loan with an interest rate compatible with the market. It makes no sense to disappear with the money where it has a collateral, that is, I deposited 200,000 USD in bitcoin to withdraw the loan of 50,000 USD. The goal was not to have to sell my bitcoins during this market rally. Therefore, the collateral was practically 4x, or in some cases 2x, the loan amount.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 127, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I placed my entire EIDL [Economic Injury Disaster Loan] loan, $525,000 in Celsius to earn an APY to help pay back the 3.9% interest on the loan while I was in the process of deciding on if I would keep the EIDL or use it on my business.\n\n\n\n  The funds in my Celsius Custodial account are not mine, they are the US Governments and I my entire business is secured and backed by these funds. If they are not returned, my business would go bankrupt, my 15 employees would be let go, and 14 years of my life’s work lost and at the age of 49 years old, I would have to start over with nothing. The thought of losing this money has left me depressed, suicidal, and without words. Please return our money.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 126, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have been a customer for about 1 year now and have transferred about $250k into Celsius. I was convinced by Alex Mashinksys AMA’s on de-banking and moving our money into Celsius.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 125, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I’ve lost my farm here in Ireland , family are left homeless . I’m mentally unstable . Family are distraught with my decisions of trusting Celsius and promising them a better future.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 124, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have been a loyal Celsius customer since 2019 and feel completely lied to by Alex Mashinsky. I watched every single AMA (Ask Me Anything) each friday since sign-up and week in and week out Alex would talk about how Celsius is safer than banks because they supposedly don’t rehypothecate and use fractional reserve lending like the banks do. “The banks are not your friends,” he would constantly say.\n\n\n\n  The money I deposited is meant as my life savings and I know I’m one of many in this situation.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 118, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I come from India to make American dream a reality and in the process, I worked hard and there are weeks that I worked for 84 hrs. a week just to make some savings, buy a home and build a life here. But all I get is disappointment and got cheated I invested all my savings for last 3 years and was able to get one full Bitcoin. Alex kept saying our investments are safe with Celsius, though there was lot of FUD on Twitter I believed Alex. I am just a normal guy trying to make a living here and keep my family safe and happy.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 117, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have held to the belief that Celsius would not engage in such risky behaviors as what has been revealed lately, and am shocked and appalled that my life is now back to square one as far as earning potential and safety for my family and young children. My life savings is gone thanks to these people.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 116, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I sent Celsius a good part of my retirement and also my wife’s last year. Alex Mashinsky has said over and over how this was a safe alternative to banking, and led me to believe interest was generated with fully collateralized loans.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 115, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have approximately $7500-10k depending on BTC price locked up and cannot withdraw from my Celsius account. I am a teacher that took a $2500 usdc loan from Celsius last summer. I do not get paid in the summer and needed some funds to get through summer so I wanted to give Celsius a try as they advertise low interest loans by utilizing collateral. I transfered $7500 worth of bitcoin as collateral for this $2500 USDC loan.\n\n\n\n  As the price of BTC started to come down this June, I kept getting emails about margin calls in about myCelsius account and how I needed to add more BTC to not get liquidated, so I deposited 2500 worth of USD to pay off the loan so I could get my collateral BTC back but the site would not allow me to transfer or make any payments, and as a result, most of my BTC collateral was liquidated and stolen by Celsius to this point. The site was frozen and I could not even withdraw my $2500 USD out that I had just deposited. I have 2 children ages 4 and 6 and these funds could have been used for their development and family obligations.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 114, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am just a 50 year old, healthcare worker. I don’t have much compared to others, but it is a lot to me and my family. All my crypto is sitting in the CUSTODY account program. Today, the value of my holdings is $19053.45 but of course, it was worth double when I purchased and I am sure it will triple in the near future. I just want my crypto back.\n\n\n\n  I am frustrated, cant sleep, my husband does not know this happened. Please do us justice. Celsius lied to us, watch the AMA videos and you will see why we all believed.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 113, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a Celsius customer with over 100k worth of deposits that are locked up in Celsius. This amount is about 90% of my life savings. Losing all of my savings will have irreparable consequences on the well-being of myself and my family. I feel ashamed to put all my trust into a company that has clearly participated in near fraudulent activity. I can’t imagine how many more years I will need to make back the money I lost.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 112, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am one of the customers who has my funds stuck with Celsius. Celsius is a company registered in the USA. Now USA being the frontrunner in almost every aspect from big businesses to new technological innovations, everyone would expect that if Celsius got its registration license in the USA, they must be running a legitimate operation, as USA is known to be strict with legal compliances related to businesses. Moreover, CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, prior to the halt of withdrawals, used to come live every week and assure the customers that Celsius is fully transparent and customers’ funds are safe. I am from India and I have $14,000 stuck with Celsius. This amount is a huge amount for an Indian. An average Indian makes $5000 a year. With my $14,000 stuck with Celsius, I have been very stressed and suicidal since the halt of withdrawals. I am the sole breadwinner of my family and its my responsibility to take care of my family members and provide food on their plates. $14,000 might not be a huge amount for an American but for me, an Indian, it is years of savings.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 111, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I started reviewing e-mails on my phone. I saw that there was an e-mail from a Crypto company that was holding about $40,000-$50,000 worth of my assets (depending on current market price). The subject of the e-mail stated that it was an important message. I opened the e-mail and began to read. By the time I finished the e-mail I had collapsed onto the floor with my head in my hands as I fought back tears.\n\n\n\n  I did my best to go the office and face my peers on June 13th, 2022. It was impossible to focus on my tasks for the day. It was like a living nightmare. However, it was nowhere near as bad as when I returned home to face my family.\n\n\n\n  My family is what would fairly be considered middle class. My wife is a teacher and I am a sales manager. It is my job to manage the family’s finances. Throughout the past two years I took an interest in trading cryptocurrency. I made a respectable profit and decided that I wanted to start a nest egg with the 7 Ethereum (valued at approximately $25k at the time) that I had earned through my trading efforts. Through a recommendation of a friend I came across Celsius. I reviewed their web site and began doing research by watching their AMA’s and reading reviews on the internet. I liked what I saw as Celsius seemed like a very transparent organization that would allow me to earn returns on my cryptocurrency as if it was in a bank.\n\n\n\n  Every day since June 13th, 2022 I have gotten up and felt terrible for a portion of the day. I look at my children and think how the money that Celsius seized from me could be put towards improving their lives. It could have been in a college fund or it could have been put towards a vacation for them to enjoy. Instead, our hard earned money was gambled away like nothing by the operators of Celsius.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 110, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have been a customer of Celsius for nearly 2 years. During this time I took out two crypto backed loans. I used the money to finance a business venture. Last month one of my loans was closed and my collateral was liquidated. I would have added more collateral, but was advised not to do so given the fact that Celsius had paused transfers and withdrawals. The liquidation of my loan has costed me approximately $21,000.\nPresently I have approximately $65,000 in savings on the Celsius platform. I put my savings there because I felt I could trust the platform and company. This trust was generated by countless hours watching Alex Mashinsky give press interviews in which he sold Celsius as a safe and secure option for savings and lending. I work in technology and have an excellent understanding of blockchain and crypto currencies. I performed due diligence on Celsius, only to learn that I have been lied to.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 109, July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I’m writing in regards to Celsius Network and their practices that have left my family and I in dark times. I joined Celsius Network earlier in the year and had deposited $15,000. Everything I had remaining for a purchase of a home for my two children and wife here in SouthWest Florida. I trusted Celsius so explicitly due to Alex Mashinsky constantly broadcasting what I thought were truths and axioms that the company and himself lived by. How clearly I was wrong. I took out a $1,000 and $5,000 loan and was unable to add necessary collateral to two margin calls that were enacted during their pause of transfers and withdrawals. The collateral was available and ready, only to watch nearly the entirety of my crypto evaporate away with no recourse to solve. I feel absolutely disgusted with what has since unfolded.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 108, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I had hundreds of thousands of dollars in USDC and Bitcoin deposited in Celsius. As part of the decision to store my assets on Celsius over the past 14 months, I listened to, and believed, Mr. Alex Mashinsky speak to the trustworthiness of Celsius on live streams, in print, and as part of the Celsius AMA (“ask me anything”) conferences he held on Fridays.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 107, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am one of many Celsius users with crypto on the platform. I deposited stable coins, believing that the yield was being generated from over collateralized loans, which Mashinsky is on record stating many times. I watched the AMAs weekly, youtube videos and twitter communications from Mashansky; he misled all of us, stating he had 2 billion in reserves, no exposure to risky practices including overleveraging. Had I known the loans were under collateralized, the balance sheet deficit, the staking, trading, etc. I would not withdrawn my coins. I avoided Terra/Luna, instead choosing stable coins backed by dollars.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 104, July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a female client from Australia with crypto deposits on the Celsius Network. Similar to many other retail investors, I and my family are severely impacted both in financial terms and mental health by the bankruptcy and locked up funds.\nI am expecting my third child in 2.5 months and need the money to pay for the doctor, hospital and expenses. Also, my aunt is seriously ill and needs my financial support for her major operation (please refer to screenshots provided below). However, all of my savings have been tied up in the Celsius network. I was planning to withdraw from Celsius to fund my birth and my aunt’s operation in late June, but due to the withdrawal halt, I don’t have access to any funds and my life has become so miserable now. I am worried that my stress due to Celsius’s situation will affect the health of my unborn child. Also, my two other children are still in primary ages and my family also need to fund locked in Celsius for their education.\n\n\n\n    \n      \n    \n      Attached copy of an email sent to Alex Mashinsky and Celsius support\n    \n  \n\n\n\nDoc 103, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I have over $25,000 worth of cryptocurrency deposited in a ‘Custody’ account with Celcius. I strongly feel that Celsius, in particular Alex Mashinsky has lied to the community about the safety of our assets. I feel like I have been lied to and mislead. I am embarrassed that I have so much money tied up in what now seems to be a scam and mismanagement of funds. It has affected me personally and now have so much anger with myself for getting my family in this position.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 102, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  Over the last year, I’d put most of my money into Celsius. I had done some research that led me to believe they were insured for any losses. As I watched companies (who had due diligence teams) put hundreds of millions into Celsius, I began putting most all of my digital currencies onto their platform. I never realized they would do the things they’ve done. I’ve put a lot of time, sweat, and money into mining digital currencies over the last year, and I really hope it’s not just all gone, now.\nWeekly, I watched Celsius’ “ask me anything” videos and would watch Alex himself say repeatedly they’re not doing shady things with our money … but it seems they were. I feel betrayed by Celsius, and shame that I even went so far as to recommend Celsius to friends and family.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 101, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  [I am] a Finnish Citizen who has invested over 50 thousand USD for Celcisus Network’s loan service. I have always been very conservative investor and invested to Celcius’s service ONLY, because Alex Machinsky has continuously stated, every Friday, that they are secure.\nThey have made claims such as:\n\n\n    Celsius is an alternative to conventional banks, they are safer than banks\n    They have over 2 billion in their balance sheet\n    They raised 750 million \"to secure customer assets if something goes wrong\"\n    Continuously assured that the funds are safe\n  \n\n\n  And so on. The whole company is a lie, we were lied to! We were deceived, I am embarrassed, sad and angry that my life savings were invested to a “bank” which was a lie. This will have significant ramifications to my retirement and it is beyond awful.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 100, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  Much of my life’s savings are currently held hostage on the Celsius platform. Alex Mashinsky week after week promised the community that our funds were safe and not being used in any risky lending. Every week during his AMA’s he promised that Celsius had the funds to cover all user assets and that under no circumstances were our funds at risk.\n\n\n\n  I have elderly parents whom I care for and the assets currently held in Celsius is to help them live out their last years in comfort. I pray I will see my funds returned in full.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 99, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  When I joined Celsius i followed every AMA and live to listen to what the CEO Alex says and update, and from what I alway heard the investment where safe, and not speculation was used in our money, plus he said multiple time they had enough cash, more then any one else to cover any issue. Some of this live were done days before they freeze assets, so Alex was lying and he knew was a lye but he kept saying that. My brother tried to suicide and I had mental disorder and I cannot sleep now, I havent slpet since the account was frozen.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 95, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  About 6 months ago I deposited 20k in BTC and ETH to Celsius (my hard earned life savings). I followed the company for more than a year before I decided to let them hold my portfolio. I spend 100+ hours listening to Mr. Mashinsky and the communication of the company. Every Friday they uploaded video’s on YouTube discussing the policy and the low risk you take as a costumer. Quotes that where said every week for over a year: “The worst thing that can happen is that everyone gets their coins back”, “We have 2billion dollars on our balance sheet so there is zero risk in depositing your crypto on Celsius.”, “Celsius is transparent and shares all of it’s financial data.”, “Celsius is safer than holding your money in the bank.”, “Celsius will take full responsibility and will make sure depositors are always prioritized.”, “Celsius is more regulatory compliant than all of it’s competitors.”\n\n\n\n\nDoc 94, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I’m a Celsius depositor. My account balance is in the mid six figure range. The balance was in the seven figure range last year when cryptocurrency prices were at their peak.\n\n\n\n  I consider myself to be “above average” in terms of understanding financial markets, as I hold an economics degree, but I am by no means an expert. The primary reason I was comfortable with Celsius was because Alex Mashinsky repeatedly stated on numerous youtube “AMAs (ask mashinsky anything)” and interviews that the yield paid on our cryptocurrency deposits was generated with overcollateralized lending. While I am no financial guru, to me, overcollateralization meant that if a debtor could not meet their obligations that Celsius would liquidate the posted collateral and ensure that the lent crypto holdings were retained.\n\n\n\n  While I am fortunate to continue to be able to support my family despite this mishap, I worry about the financially vulnerable individuals who put their life savings into Celsius because they were encouraged to do so by Alex Mashinsky, despite the fact that he knew that the company was struggling from a financial standpoint. Single mothers, retirees, and other vulnerable individuals absolutely need their savings back.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 92, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am very affected by Celsius Network freezing my account and filing bankruptcy due to lack of risk management and false promises. Even though my assets were not in six figures, that was the majority of my life savings and retirement fund. As per their marketing and promotion, they promise withdrawal of our assets anytime. But When I tried withdrawing my cryptocurrency on June 13th, they did not let me withdraw.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 90, filed July 20, 2022:\n\n\n  I am one of the many customers affected by these proceedings with a large portion of my savings…\n\n\n\n  [B]eginning on 13 June 2022, I was stonewalled into having a loan with Celsius liquidated. This was primarily due to Celsius freezing transfers which took away all ability for users to manage their loans on their own. This forced users to rely on their support team, which was not able to react in time. Celsius froze transfers on 12 June 2022 and directed customers to contact support in order to resolve a margin call, advertising a 24-48 hour response time. On 13 June 2022, I received notification of a margin call and e-mailed support attempted to call their customer support line only to sit on hold for 4 hours only to be hung up on. My loan was liquidated on 18 June 2022. The first time I heard back from Celsius regarding this matter was 21 June, 8 days after initial contact, saying nothing can be done about it now. I requested a refund of the liquidation fee to show a sign of good faith to the customers only to be ignored again.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 89, filed July 20, 2022:\n\n\n  I am an unaccredited investor who trusted Celsius with over $530,000 of Crypto Currency as of today Wednesday July 20th. As of April 2nd, 2022, this bucket of Crypto was valued over $1,000,000. I moved the bulk of these funds into Celsius in February of 2022 because I would Watch Alex Mashinsky on his weekly AMAs published on YouTube. He reiterated time and time again on Twitter and on these AMAs that the company was over collateralized and that should anything go wrong they have more than enough money to make all depositors whole. He also started that he himself would personally compensate investors to make them whole if ever needed.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 86, filed July 20, 2022:\n\n\n  I was one of many common retail investors that invested my money with Celsius after their constant advertisements and promotions of “Earn great & safe APY returns like the rich. You can access your money at any time, your crypto is always safe with us.” On and on the false promises went.\n\n\n\n  As a disabled Combat Veteran who served in the Afghanistan Campaign, it hasn’t been easy for me to maintain employment and save money to build a future retirement for my family. So, I have been saving for years to amass the sum that I had in Celsius. To Celsius I am but a minnow in a sea of whales. My 36k loan to Celsius that took me nearly a decade to save for with dedication and hard work for feels completely insignificant.\n\n\n\n  Please help us common tax paying citizens who were just trying to get a fair shake at trying to save for the future while beating inflation rates.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 83, filed July 20, 2022:\n\n\n  I share a similar story as other depositors and investors of Celsius. I started depositing various crypto assets with Celsius Earn a little over a year ago (March 2021). I trusted Celsius with my funds and continued to do so despite market volatility and rumors about Celsius solvency on Twitter. CEO Alex Mashinsky reassured everyone on various media platform that Celsius is financially strong and had enough collateral to weather the downturn in the market. I left my all of my ETH (about 60 ETH [~$92,500 on date of filing]) on Celsius in hopes for a modest return (not enough to beat current inflation) and now, like others, my ETH is locked and I have no way to access it.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 82, filed July 20, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a Celsius amount holder, with .85 Bitcoin [~$19,900 on date of filing], 1 ETH [~$1,500 on date of filing], and a various amount of other crypto currencies. I am writing to ask you to not grant Celsius to move forward with their current plan with Mashinsky, or any current executive leadership. I was clearly and unequivocally misled to believe that my funds were not used in risky leverage trading, and that they were completely secure unrelated to market conditions. It is obvious that there has been reckless misuse, and Celsius is not taking responsibility for their actions and cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 78, filed July 21, 2022:\n\n\n  I am writing to you today, as a Celsius user (since January 2021), that currently has my life savings in crypto locked and inaccessible. Alex Mashinsky and the Celsius Management Team expressed multiple times, on Tuesday Twitter Spaces and Friday YouTube AMA’s (Ask Mashinsky Anything), the following phrases: “UnBank Yourself”, “HODL with Celsius”, “Banks Are Not Your Friends” and “Do Good, then Do Well”.\n\n\n\n  Retail investors have even expressed “suicidal statements” on Twitter as a result of this unforeseen incident. I even referred friends and family to Celsius and their life savings are now in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 71, filed July 20, 2022:\n\n\n  As of July 13, Celsius Network claims they are no longer liquidating retail loans or demanding margin calls, but accepting loan repayments and continuing to hold coins posted as collateral. As a retail user with two current loans due on August 14 and August 28, I want to honor my obligation of paying back the principal and interest on my loans so that I may receive my ~4x collateral back. However, it makes no financial sense to send money to a bankrupt company when it is unknown what will happen to my collateral. Sir, I am requesting special consideration for all future loans that are due and especially the ones that are ~4x collateralized.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 68, filed July 19, 2022:\n\n\n  My life savings were in Celsius. I trusted Alex. I pray and hope everyday you are doing everything in your power to rightfully return deposits back to customers. I can’t tell my wife and kids our retirement and dreams have been stolen from us. Life is stale, we need updates and silence is not the answer. Please I request you to help put the interest of unsecured creditors, or as Alex famously called his “community” first.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 65, filed July 19, 2022:\n\n\n  I am a Celsius customer with a little over $15k worth of deposits that are locked up in Celsius. $15k may not mean a lot to some people, but it is about 65% or my life savings.\n\n\n\n  Losing all of my savings will have irreparable consequences on the well-being of myself and my family. I am ashamed, humiliated, and quite frankly, disgusted, that I put all my trust into a company that has clearly participated in near fraudulent activity. I will be spending years trying to make back the money I lost.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 64, filed July 19, 2022:\n\n\n  I only have about $3500 (at today’s value as of July 19th). But for me it is a very large amount. It is approximately ½ of my investment portfolio. The only reason I put it there was because I thought Celsius was safe. I was only earning 3-5% on my BTC/ETH, and since ETH when it is staked to ETH2.0 earns about 6-7%, I figured it was fine. The way they (in their weekly AMA’s) explained it, was that the funds were either staked on the net with “safe” options such as ETH2.0 and MATIC. Or that it was lent out with over collateralized loans to individuals/institutions. Instead they took massive risks with them.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 51, filed July 19, 2022:\n\n\n  I share a similar story to many other depositors who have modest amounts of their net worth locked in Celsius. From spending time on various social media forums and groups I have seen the range of devastation this lockup has caused.\n\n\n\n  I like many others were led astray by Mr. Mashinsky and his lies. We trusted the company was ran in a safe and productive manner because their leader always expressed that. I do not believe these terms of services should be deemed valid. There is zero chance I or others would have become a customer of Celsius if their terrible business practices were disclosed.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 50, filed July 19, 2022:\n\n\n  Like many investors, I have lost a large chunk of my life savings and struggle to live daily with devastation and extreme stress of watching on the sideline feeling powerless over my money, which I entrusted with Celsius to manage. Alex Mashinsky and Celsius Management have been engaging in deceptive marketing of their platform and products using catchy phrases such as “Unbank yourself” and “Banks are not your friends” to imply that leaving funds with Celsius is just like depositing funds on savings accounts with traditional banks, if not superior.\n\n\n\n  Celsius customer base extends beyond the United States and its impacts are far‐reaching and impacting the lives of Non‐US resident depositors like myself.\n\n\n\n\nDoc 47, filed July 15, 2022:\n\n\n  This has ruined people beyond comprehension: please peruse r/CelsiusNetwork should you have a human interest in what is happening with people who are not as sophisticated as yourself even. The marketing lies, the deceit, and the lack of accountability will be paid in blood by many.\n\n\n\n  This person preyed on fears of losing money during the next economic downturn and lied about how our money/assets were managed.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Disclosures for my work and writing pertaining to cryptocurrencies and web3 can be found here.\n    \n    \n  \n","length":44754,"excerpt":"People with funds locked in Celsius Network have been sending letters to the judge presiding over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.
