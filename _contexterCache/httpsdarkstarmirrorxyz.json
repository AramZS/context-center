Other than broad similarities in the way new inventions evolve and are adopted, the unique way a technology interacts with a culture at a particular moment in history is so specific that such comparisons likely miss more than they predict. But there is something resonant in analogies between the dissemination of the ‘original’ Internet (in, say, the 1990s), the social components of Web2 and the present-day rise of blockchain technologies. The commonality is <em>evident</em>. This is why crypto folks refer to those early Internet days so often. Both represent, in their own ways daunting and inspiring, a <em>radical</em> re-architecture of communications and commerce.</p><p>This analogous radical ambition of the early Internet and what we often call Web3 today results in some similar implications for users. Rather than being able to employ existing technologies to participate in the new wave of culture, individuals and organizations are encouraged to learn and adopt new means to coordinate and participate in cultural evolution. In the early 1990s, adventurous internet hobbyists  were faced with the challenges of setting up modems, installing socket drivers, and finding and navigating servers with unique and obscure commands. Each of these steps required self motivation and was in itself a hurdle. Each step, offered with minimal support, was a barrier to adoption. Like today, the early internet required a maverick mindset to push beyond the existing comfort zone. Even for those wary of comparisons, this similarity to Web3 is undeniable.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd

you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” - Steve Jobs</p>\n</blockquote><p>We do these things…</p><blockquote>\n<p>“…not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” - John F.

class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><p><strong>We are entering the age of living online</strong>. An increasing number of people have employment that exists only online. We have meaningful relationships that are primarily or even only online. It should not be surprising that a growing number of us -- especially we who are most intensely online -- are embracing the concept of ‘owning’ online things. A belief in the value of NFTs is a logical extension of the vitality of online experience and existence. </p><p>As with the ‘real world,’ the things we own enable important connections to other people. If we own related things, we may share similar personalities, interests or life situations. We may have a common vested interest in preserving or increasing their ongoing value. We may also be engaged in a kind of game with each other, competing to purchase more or more special versions of the item. We are bound together by economic commitments. </p><p>The archetypal example in the physical world is real estate. Where we live is a huge part of our identity and, usually, our net worth. By owning property in the same neighborhood, we have committed, at least to some extent, to a shared destiny. When we volunteer, for example, for an event or organization that makes the block a nicer place to live, when we organize or sponsor services that enrich the area, it enhances the value of everyone’s home. As the value of the neighborhood increases, we benefit together, both in terms of status as well as financially. As our relationships and sense of self become more embedded in the neighborhood, we become more attached to the property, deepening the connection and spurring active engagement. In healthy neighborhoods, all residents benefit from this ‘virtuous circle.’ Ownership leads to meaningful engagement which leads to increased desirability.. </p><p>NFT collections, and especially the latest wave of ‘avatar communities’ aka PFP collections, have the potential to mirror this healthy dynamic. When we own a SupDuck or Cryptoad, we have a motivation to engage in behavior that makes everyone’s ownership more significant. As ‘residents’ of that virtual neighborhood, we all have an interest in broadening the list of ‘stuff you get’ as part of your NFT. And yet, the vast majority of these projects pay only lip service to that potential. The vast majority of projects offer only hand-waving assurances of future amenities. Rather than investing in genuinely valuable services for its community, the focus tends rather to be on shilling and stunts to generate FOMO. </p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div

embracing — loss of control.</em></p><p>In the 20th Century, media became an industrial product. This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford&#x27;s Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.</p><p>The heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a

In technology, versions are successors. When the new model comes out, we upgrade and the older one is replaced and forgotten.</p><p>Is this what we mean when we refer to Web3? Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web2? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)</p><p>Many blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd bc5nci5 bc5nci4rq bc5nciih bc5ncix7 bc5nci584 bc5nci4sd bc5nci4sl yfzfkjm bc5nci3lg bc5nci3rz bc5nci6t bc5ncivj bc5nci154 yfzfkj1c bc5nci50y bc5nci4ti bc5nci4tp bc5nci4tn yfzfkjd\" href=\"/aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\"><div class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywpl1 bc5nci51u bc5nci4rt bc5ncivt bc5nciwd  _2gklefb bc5nci3dt bc5nci4sp\">Continue Reading</div></a></div></div><div class=\"css-hkjsyc\"></div><div class=\"css-1snnz1k\"><div class=\"css-cts56n\"><a href=\"/eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\"><div class=\"css-1bncbpx\"><div><h1 class=\"css-1b1esvm\">Cities of Ghosts Await Their DAO Revival</h1></div></div></a></div><style data-emotion=\"css 16f77nt\">.css-16f77nt{padding-left:1rem;padding-right:1rem;max-width:45rem;width:100%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;}@media screen and (min-width: 768px){.css-16f77nt{padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;}}</style><div class=\"css-16f77nt\"><div class=\"css-37sef5\"><div class=\"css-c6ixvj\"><style data-emotion=\"css ia2eld\">.css-ia2eld{display:block;-webkit-align-self:center;-ms-flex-item-align:center;align-self:center;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;-ms-flex-negative:0;flex-shrink:0;margin-right:0.75rem;margin-bottom:0.75rem;}</style><style data-emotion=\"css 5f70j4\">.css-5f70j4{box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;min-width:0;-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:inherit;display:block;-webkit-align-self:center;-ms-flex-item-align:center;align-self:center;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;-ms-flex-negative:0;flex-shrink:0;margin-right:0.75rem;margin-bottom:0.75rem;}</style><a class=\"css-5f70j4\" href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">0x7FdC</div></div></a><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><div class=\"css-qng491\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">June 2nd, 2021</div></div></div><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><a href=\"/eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\"><svg fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" style=\"height:16px;width:16px;display:block\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"></path></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><p>a glick x tal x darkstar jam</p><figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><div data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%\"><img style=\"display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjA3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM5NyIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4=\"/></span><img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F70ada907-cd8c-40fc-8a13-813418b306c4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F70ada907-cd8c-40fc-8a13-813418b306c4.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F70ada907-cd8c-40fc-8a13-813418b306c4.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/></noscript></span><button aria-label=\"Zoom image\" data-rmiz-btn-open=\"true\"></button></div></figure><p>If you walk the streets of any American neighborhood or town more than, say, 100 years-old, you’ll see ghosts.</p><p>Not the ghosts of previous inhabitants, although that’s also possible.

You can see them in the fading signs for men’s fraternities and women’s leagues that no longer meet, the labor halls renovated for restaurants and condos, and the community centers for ethnic and immigrant groups that have long since decamped for the suburbs. You can see those ghosts in the statues of beloved (often dubious) heroes that were erected by the regiments (or descendants) of veterans of various wars, the money painstakingly raised through membership subscription. Most of all, you can see them in the old churches, each for a subtly different but vigorous denomination, once the pride of their parishioners, now usually empty.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd bc5nci5 bc5nci4rq bc5nciih bc5ncix7 bc5nci584 bc5nci4sd bc5nci4sl yfzfkjm bc5nci3lg bc5nci3rz bc5nci6t bc5ncivj bc5nci154 yfzfkj1c bc5nci50y bc5nci4ti bc5nci4tp bc5nci4tn yfzfkjd\" href=\"/eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\"><div class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywpl1 bc5nci51u bc5nci4rt bc5ncivt bc5nciwd  _2gklefb bc5nci3dt bc5nci4sp\">Continue Reading</div></a></div></div><div class=\"css-hkjsyc\"></div><div class=\"css-1snnz1k\"><div class=\"css-cts56n\"><a href=\"/q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\"><div class=\"css-1bncbpx\"><div><h1 class=\"css-1b1esvm\">Balancing the Meta: The Role of Games in a Crypto World</h1></div></div></a></div><div class=\"css-16f77nt\"><div class=\"css-37sef5\"><div class=\"css-c6ixvj\"><a class=\"css-5f70j4\" href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">0x7FdC</div></div></a><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><div class=\"css-qng491\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">May 20th, 2021</div></div></div><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><a href=\"/q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\"><svg fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" style=\"height:16px;width:16px;display:block\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"></path></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><p>*a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flynn</a> x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanglick\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">glick</a> x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweettal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tal</a> x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jarroddicker\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dicker</a> joint *</p><figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><div data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%\"><img style=\"display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNjEwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjkxOCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4=\"/></span><img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F576dfd5e-59cf-480b-a05d-df015d40216f.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F576dfd5e-59cf-480b-a05d-df015d40216f.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F576dfd5e-59cf-480b-a05d-df015d40216f.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/></noscript></span><button aria-label=\"Zoom image\" data-rmiz-btn-open=\"true\"></button></div></figure><p>In the morning, you’re picking crops on the farm. By afternoon, you enter the arena to do battle. This isn’t a remake of the movie Gladiator. It’s one Anon’s day in the world of crypto games. As DeFi, NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies compete for mindshare, the entire crypto world is not only borrowing heavily from game mechanics but increasingly becoming a single massive integrated game itself. This is the inevitable result of user sovereignty. Interoperable protocols provide the freedom to move between thousands of dapps and blockchains, so developers are leaning into gamification in order to put a leash on existing users and keep them coming back for more.</p><p>Game designers are, of course, experts in terms of keeping people engaged for long periods of time, even more than social media companies. Where social media companies have a recurring strategy to get someone to engage and then keep them engaged (ie. monetizing their attention through ads), games are different. Games look to draw you in at an initial (often free) engagement, but then encourage you to build status and identity within the experience itself. Mapping all this to crypto is easy. The users make purchases (see: NFTs) that make your social involvement (see: social tokens) unique. The experience blends intrinsic and extrinsic incentives to keep you invested (financially &amp; socially) in the experience itself.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd bc5nci5 bc5nci4rq bc5nciih bc5ncix7 bc5nci584 bc5nci4sd bc5nci4sl yfzfkjm bc5nci3lg bc5nci3rz bc5nci6t bc5ncivj bc5nci154 yfzfkj1c bc5nci50y bc5nci4ti bc5nci4tp bc5nci4tn yfzfkjd\" href=\"/q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\"><div class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywpl1 bc5nci51u bc5nci4rt bc5ncivt bc5nciwd  _2gklefb bc5nci3dt bc5nci4sp\">Continue Reading</div></a></div></div><div class=\"css-hkjsyc\"></div><div class=\"css-1snnz1k\"><div class=\"css-cts56n\"><a href=\"/jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\"><div class=\"css-1bncbpx\"><div><h1 class=\"css-1b1esvm\">The Next Social Graph: Splits, Supports and Attributions</h1></div></div></a></div><div class=\"css-16f77nt\"><div class=\"css-37sef5\"><div class=\"css-c6ixvj\"><a class=\"css-5f70j4\" href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">0x7FdC</div></div></a><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><div class=\"css-qng491\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">May 13th, 2021</div></div></div><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><a href=\"/jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\"><svg fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" style=\"height:16px;width:16px;display:block\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"></path></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><p>a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanglick?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">glick</a> x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweettal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tal</a> x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flynn</a> x dicker joint</p><figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><div data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%\"><img style=\"display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNDc3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE3MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4=\"/></span><img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F4b8cd854-77f9-4bfd-a69f-ab68b08094d9.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F4b8cd854-77f9-4bfd-a69f-ab68b08094d9.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F4b8cd854-77f9-4bfd-a69f-ab68b08094d9.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/></noscript></span><button aria-label=\"Zoom image\" data-rmiz-btn-open=\"true\"></button></div></figure><p>You’re inspired.</p><p>You’ve read a bunch of articles, blog posts, and essays and suddenly see that blinding flash of realization.

As the two sides became more familiar with each other, they began to trade.</p><p>Within a few years, there was a temporary camp in that bend of the river. It was a perfect place to meet. The two sides would do business, swap stories and eat together. Soon traders were coming throughout the year. The camp became permanent and then became a town.

Three years later, we&#x27;ve hit many of the milestones. Below is an update to the original version that includes some recent advancements.</em></p><p>Reputation, on the Internet, has been warped. We’ve built an information system that rewards recency and relevancy mechanics, with an aim more towards discoverability than integrity. It has become a competition to generate results for result’s sake. We’ve strayed away from the efforts that make something truly reputable and instead over-indexed on the end result, generalizing how we value information on the web today. It doesn’t matter what you put into it as long as what comes out matches the criteria for success. And that’s wrong.</p><p>There’s a very simple reason for this behavior: we don’t know what the systems to derive reputation look like on a global scale. It’s not quantifiable, and at a baseline isn’t a definition that is mutually agreed upon by all. Filtering this much content on the web, even in groups powered by large computing systems, is too influenced by outside sociological and political pressures. This filtering pushes towards filter bubbles and separates in an effort to integrate.

In the music industry, talent is the driving force behind its business. Talent is the source of the reputation and the end of the line when it comes to driving financial returns. Without world-class talent creating great products, it doesn’t matter how well you promote or polish it — the results will be the same.</p><p>The “monetize the individual” disruption in media serves as an opportunity for business reinvention of companies who choose to recognize and react to this newly acknowledged trend forming. It’s not just about enabling and liberating talent, but more importantly about maintaining, supporting and growing that individual’s business better than they’re able to do on their own or elsewhere. The future media business will extend to newfound territory that fortunately for them, is right in its wheelhouse: Talent Management (Artists and Repertoire A&amp;R).</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd bc5nci5 bc5nci4rq bc5nciih bc5ncix7 bc5nci584 bc5nci4sd bc5nci4sl yfzfkjm bc5nci3lg bc5nci3rz bc5nci6t bc5ncivj bc5nci154 yfzfkj1c bc5nci50y bc5nci4ti bc5nci4tp bc5nci4tn yfzfkjd\" href=\"/hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\"><div class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywpl1 bc5nci51u bc5nci4rt bc5ncivt bc5nciwd  _2gklefb bc5nci3dt bc5nci4sp\">Continue Reading</div></a></div></div><div class=\"css-hkjsyc\"></div><div class=\"css-1snnz1k\"><div class=\"css-cts56n\"><a href=\"/bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\"><div class=\"css-1bncbpx\"><div><h1 class=\"css-1b1esvm\">NFTs Need an Audience: Utility, Consumption and Building New Worlds</h1></div></div></a></div><div class=\"css-16f77nt\"><div class=\"css-37sef5\"><div class=\"css-c6ixvj\"><a class=\"css-5f70j4\" href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">0x7FdC</div></div></a><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><div class=\"css-qng491\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">March 8th, 2021</div></div></div><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><a href=\"/bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\"><svg fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" style=\"height:16px;width:16px;display:block\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"></path></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><div data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"><div class=\"css-ovd0pw\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa31f9bc-c42a-48df-b557-67e3f53bc0ac_1536x2048.jpeg\" class=\"css-r0ukz2\"/></div><button aria-label=\"Zoom image\" data-rmiz-btn-open=\"true\"></button></div></figure><p><em>a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweettal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tweettal</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanglick\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jonathanglick</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jarroddicker\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jarroddicker</a> joint. remixed from <a href=\"https://tals.substack.com/p/nfts-need-an-audience\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trends, Analysis, Lies &amp; Statistics</a>.</em></p><p>The places and ways to enjoy NFTs, especially for non-owners, essentially do not exist. While this is a problem, it makes sense. The breakthrough idea behind NFTs was that unique digital objects could be owned. So the initial set of applications were those directly involved in buying, selling, and storing. We needed marketplaces to shop and bid and wallets to pay with and hold our purchases. These are experiences that emphasize the private and personal nature of an NFT. But as with owned physical objects, this transactional aspect is only part of appreciating a possession. For any item with utility beyond immediate sustenance and safety, value is created socially. We understand its worth based on what the broader community thinks it’s worth. Right now, the community of people valuing NFTs is only the people making and buying them.  For a sense of scale, the <a href=\"https://dappradar.com/rankings\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">top 25 decentralized apps</a> all together, not just those related to NFTs, probably had less than 250,000 transacting wallet/users over the last 24 hours, and nearly half of these were at Dapper’s Top Shots. For NFTs to reach their true potential, we need to build much farther-reaching consumption experiences. And to not repeat the same mistakes of our current digital era, we need these platforms to maintain a decentralized ethos.</p><p>As any asset begins to accrue greater recognition and deeper social significance, its value moves beyond being predominantly transactional and towards an expression of the owner’s identity. Its value transcends the actual product and comes to attribute worth to the owners themself. As this value is socialized, the community starts to not only associate the worth with the product but with the person too. <em>This is true in the physical world, where the identification with something you own is different from that of something you rent, lease, or borrow</em>. It is also true with NFTs. But, all of this won’t happen at scale without NFTs reaching and being adopted by the broader community.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd bc5nci5 bc5nci4rq bc5nciih bc5ncix7 bc5nci584 bc5nci4sd bc5nci4sl yfzfkjm bc5nci3lg bc5nci3rz bc5nci6t bc5ncivj bc5nci154 yfzfkj1c bc5nci50y bc5nci4ti bc5nci4tp bc5nci4tn yfzfkjd\" href=\"/bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\"><div class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywpl1 bc5nci51u bc5nci4rt bc5ncivt bc5nciwd  _2gklefb bc5nci3dt bc5nci4sp\">Continue Reading</div></a></div></div><div class=\"css-hkjsyc\"></div><div class=\"css-1snnz1k\"><div class=\"css-cts56n\"><a href=\"/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\"><div class=\"css-1bncbpx\"><div><h1 class=\"css-1b1esvm\">A New Media Structure: The Ownership Economy</h1></div></div></a></div><div class=\"css-16f77nt\"><div class=\"css-37sef5\"><div class=\"css-c6ixvj\"><a class=\"css-5f70j4\" href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">0x7FdC</div></div></a><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><div class=\"css-qng491\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">March 1st, 2021</div></div></div><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><a href=\"/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\"><svg fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" style=\"height:16px;width:16px;display:block\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"></path></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><div data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"><div class=\"css-ovd0pw\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/KRvJe99Df2drWk2SeW4BFGwDKkHz8KTk5q0G12saOQk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9cb8bd777f3aaad099efb4fcc6e08d3003455768\" class=\"css-r0ukz2\"/></div><button aria-label=\"Zoom image\" data-rmiz-btn-open=\"true\"></button></div></figure><p><em><strong>a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jarroddicker\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jarroddicker</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flynnjamm</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patrickxrivera</a> joint</strong></em></p><p>Media companies are talent companies.

Top talent wants more control and ownership over their work, having options to transcend their reputation and financial success from a parent brand.</p></div></div><div class=\"css-b5ejjm\"></div><div class=\"css-1irurgy\"><a class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywplf bc5nci4pb bc5nci1gd bc5nci5 bc5nci4rq bc5nciih bc5ncix7 bc5nci584 bc5nci4sd bc5nci4sl yfzfkjm bc5nci3lg bc5nci3rz bc5nci6t bc5ncivj bc5nci154 yfzfkj1c bc5nci50y bc5nci4ti bc5nci4tp bc5nci4tn yfzfkjd\" href=\"/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\"><div class=\"_1sjywpl0 _1sjywpl1 bc5nci51u bc5nci4rt bc5ncivt bc5nciwd  _2gklefb bc5nci3dt bc5nci4sp\">Continue Reading</div></a></div></div><div class=\"css-hkjsyc\"></div><div class=\"css-1snnz1k\"><div class=\"css-cts56n\"><a href=\"/9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\"><div class=\"css-1bncbpx\"><div><h1 class=\"css-1b1esvm\">Breaking the Fourth Wall: The Business of Media Subculture</h1></div></div></a></div><div class=\"css-16f77nt\"><div class=\"css-37sef5\"><div class=\"css-c6ixvj\"><a class=\"css-5f70j4\" href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">0x7FdC</div></div></a><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><div class=\"css-qng491\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\">January 14th, 2021</div></div></div><div class=\"css-150ro3b\"><a href=\"/9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\"><div class=\"css-xnt5cy\"><div class=\"css-1cmd7eo\"><svg fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" style=\"height:16px;width:16px;display:block\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2.5\"></path></svg></div></div></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1mdgjlt\"><div><figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><div data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%\"><img style=\"display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjE2MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNjIwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIvPg==\"/></span><img alt=\"Trey Anastasio, Phish, Nashville 2018\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Trey Anastasio, Phish, Nashville 2018\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F25cafc24-71f1-4f50-93e6-02ada2762b21.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 1x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F25cafc24-71f1-4f50-93e6-02ada2762b21.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/></noscript></span><button aria-label=\"Zoom image\" data-rmiz-btn-open=\"true\"></button></div><figcaption>Trey Anastasio, Phish, Nashville 2018</figcaption></figure><p>If media companies are record labels and creators are rock stars then the audience are fans — and that introduces an entirely new business opportunity.<br/>\n<!-- -->Media, like music, can only thrive when the audience and the creator travel down a path together, giving each other the opportunity to define one another.

We like to talk about how blockchains are *like* cities. About how [tokens](https://www.citycoins.co) and [DAOs](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA) can improve the governance and economy of cities. And about building new cities in the [Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) and even in the [real world](https://www.praxissociety.com/content/introducing-praxis). But recently, in the context of [NYC NFT](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/nfts-take-over-nyc/) and [Solana Lisbon](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/solana-throws-a-three-day-party-for-itself/) and now [Art Basel-Miami](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/12/01/art-and-crypto-a-marriage-made-in-miami), a new urban crypto phenomenon has become clear: the moving city.\\n\\nIndividuals, small project teams, packs of enthusiasts, investors and entrepreneurs, all of them descend on a single geographic location, and for a week or so, make a city within a city. They gather for discussions, presentations and parties. Most importantly, they gather to do *work*. In hotel lobbies and coffee shops, people meet to advance the collaborations they mainly pursued online. In night clubs and bars, they meet to dance and drink and play. It was as if Manhattan and Brooklyn, at least in certain neighborhoods, became an IRL version of their Twitter timelines, Discords and Slacks. What was even more remarkable was how many of the same people reappeared only a few weeks later in Lisbon, regrouping into the same kind of brainstorms and collab sessions. It was like a migration.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/41R6kxOlhBqC6punRaBzN.jpeg?height=980\\u0026width=1485)\\n\\nIn retrospect, this development should have been obvious and predictable. It’s a natural progression. Trade fairs are as old as recorded history. Industry conferences and off-sites are both antecedents. And the combination of Zoom presence and Airbnb as a source of easy to access live/work/play residences made remote employment from anywhere practical. But what really makes the moving city inevitable is the nature of work, and of building, on the blockchain. The crypto get-together is a unique social form: sort of a trade show, sort of an academic conference but, most importantly, also sort of a *company offsite*, where employees meet people from other teams in their big corporation, bond, build morale and get inculcated into company culture. The web3 conference is all of those forms at once, because blockchain projects are distinct and competitive while being deeply cooperative in the way departments in a company are all working ultimately to increase the value of the overall enterprise (and stock price.)\\n\\nYou can be based anywhere with broadband, working with their various project teams and DAOs through collaboration tools, Zoom and Metaverse-y like spaces, and then on a regular basis, perhaps as often as eight to ten times a year, converge on a fun location for a major blockchain event. It could be for several weeks or as long as necessary as new efforts spring up from the fertile cross-pollination of in-person engagement. The availability of residential style rentals makes a longer stay pleasant, less like a frantic trade show and more conducive to real work and relationship-building. And it’s awesome: why stay in one place? Why not see the world, and your friends, while doing what you love? It’s not a coincidence that event-hopping from wonderful locale to wonderful locale mimics the emerging experience and architecture of the Metaverse, and vice versa.\\n\\nA powerful driver of this is that many attendees aren’t *really* meeting for the first time. A large number of them have been in constant contact for months, even years. They have invested together, built together, ‘woken up’ every morning with the daily routine of a ‘gm’ to their online collaborators. Crypto people, especially if they are young, have been building their entire careers and fortunes with people they’ve probably never seen in person, and the ability to make that friendship closer is rich with meaning. It is emotional, significant for their mental health, even spiritual.\\n\\nThere are also parallels between how web3 enthusiasts approach conferences and the way that they approach centralized social networks. As much as there’s a desire to spin out and develop something new, there’s also the awareness – and deliberate strategic choice – that most word-of-mouth recruiting and collaborating needs to happen where people currently are. Let’s look at Twitter for instance: the amount of energy and time spent by folks in web3 to talk about decentralization and the need for a “new Twitter” *on Twitter* is rampant. But recognizing that these existing communities are where the potential opportunity lies (marketing + recruiting), the centralized social services are key tools to get more people aware and involved, “on the bus”. The same goes for physical cities. While web3 boasts an ability to live truly online, there’s a strong desire to leverage the venues offline as they are as, if not more, important in building a truly connected culture that exists outside the the programming of web3 communities.\\n\\nAll this has a powerful impact on the places being ‘temporarily occupied.’  When something comes to your city, you pay attention. When Phish plays a festival in rural Maine or New York, weeks of local coverage and small business preparation is done in lieu of the masses parachuting down into the town. But what this also does is spark the conversation. Yes, there are many who opt into these experiences, who are fluent and are already ‘on the bus.’ But the ‘what’ becomes less important than the ‘why’ when it comes to bringing more awareness and participation to the movement.\\n\\n\\u003e **[“eternal joy and never ending splendor.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HoDlGNTisI)**\\n\\nThis phenomenon is very analogous to that of touring fans. Like Phish, the Dead, BTS and other acts that have built a culture around their trade, the show itself isn’t the main event. The show is the catalyst of getting people together, an excuse to congregate with like minded people at a moment in time and take that energy with them back to their “homes” once it’s over. And when done right, this desire to connect never ends. It is very rare to be able to break the fourth wall in such a way where the community itself leverages a “thing” to drive action, but the culture itself is sustained and maintained without the “thing” needing to be present at all.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p0Vd0C5hkaz7txa4am-iL.png?height=530\\u0026width=800)\\n\\nAnd like touring fans and their bands, each stop is an opportunity to get more folks to hop on the bus. In a culture built on virtual land, without a catalyst to see and feel in person, it’s seemingly prohibitive for many to deeply “get it” and take the time to learn. On the most obvious level, online puts most of the onus on the product, technology and platforms that unlock this feeling of web3. And because of where we are in the web3 lifecycle (it’s early!), it can be discouraging for most to take the time to deeply understand why this world is more fun. The human elements of connection and collaboration are seemingly being worked on, but it’s a lot easier to understand where you’re there. So much so that many who are the most deep in this space never want to miss a “show.” They make sure they’re there, to see their friends, partners and recruit more individuals who are interested, excited in sharing the same ideals of a new world.\\n\\nWhere there is unique nuance is that the idea of a ‘company’ in web3 culture transcends that of a single project or practice. Typically at these conferences, each individual is representative of their brand and is there to sell something. In this case of web3, everyone is there for the proverbial company “web3” or “Bitcoin” or “Ethereum” or “Solana” or… you get it. The purpose of it is to connect with others who are building towards a shared goal, versus sell others on a competitive edge. Sure that happens, but that’s not why people are there. Being in the same “room” as others offers the ability to partner deeper and collaborate for the bigger purpose. The company itself is the movement that everyone is collectively constructing.\\n\\nAnd then, like the circus, it’s over. The tents are packed away. The company disaggregates and people go back to wherever home is. But only temporarily, because there’s another gathering only a few weeks or months away, in some other enticing location, with some new tantalizing theme or mission. It’s likely these events will become more numerous and bigger as this transformation continues: a great circuit of tribal migration, of creators, investors, activists and collectors moving together around the globe.\\n\\n*the bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began.*\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"zKO5g95VOExNHYe-fSpRQj92928gO3yse77rO_fYFXw\",\"timestamp\":1638463789,\"title\":\"Crypto World Tour 2022: The Moving City of Friends \",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"address\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a3ef6b7-0ab8-4fe0-a60f-6cd171849e49.jpg?height=3088\\u0026width=2316\",\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Jonathanglick\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null}],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"XdzGaKgCMXmm7Xgaai_u4-iv7MCjF025sip_TJSDrVo\",\"body\":\"*press “play” before you begin…*\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8AfIeJOxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8AfIeJOxw)\\n\\nIt’s not very helpful to make direct comparisons between the evolution of technologies. Other than broad similarities in the way new inventions evolve and are adopted, the unique way a technology interacts with a culture at a particular moment in history is so specific that such comparisons likely miss more than they predict. But there is something resonant in analogies between the dissemination of the ‘original’ Internet (in, say, the 1990s), the social components of Web2 and the present-day rise of blockchain technologies. The commonality is *evident*. This is why crypto folks refer to those early Internet days so often. Both represent, in their own ways daunting and inspiring, a *radical* re-architecture of communications and commerce.\\n\\nThis analogous radical ambition of the early Internet and what we often call Web3 today results in some similar implications for users. Rather than being able to employ existing technologies to participate in the new wave of culture, individuals and organizations are encouraged to learn and adopt new means to coordinate and participate in cultural evolution. In the early 1990s, adventurous internet hobbyists  were faced with the challenges of setting up modems, installing socket drivers, and finding and navigating servers with unique and obscure commands. Each of these steps required self motivation and was in itself a hurdle. Each step, offered with minimal support, was a barrier to adoption. Like today, the early internet required a maverick mindset to push beyond the existing comfort zone. Even for those wary of comparisons, this similarity to Web3 is undeniable. \\n  \\n Blockchain advocates like us often frame these frustrations as an optimistic portent. If the path of the original Internet proves that the complexities of onboarding millions of users to a whole new paradigm will eventually be overcome, then the payoff will be significant. But the comparison tends to take the long term view of that path without examining the steps along the way. In particular, scant attention is being paid to the actual way most early consumers were able to comprehend and access the Internet. In the early internet, this function emerged through online services and particularly, through [America Online](https://www.aol.com/).\\n\\nIt’s difficult now to remember how confusing computers, let alone the Internet, were for most users in the mid-90s. Even by 1997, [only 35%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/1999/apr/wk1/mobile/art01.htm) of US households had a computer. For many of those early adopters, the value proposition of the Internet, most importantly email, was compelling, but ‘getting online’ was so time-consuming and complicated that it required hands-on help to set up. It was into this capability gap that the online services emerged.\\n\\n![source: https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/1999/apr/wk1/mobile/art01.htm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3orm9oifJxYvAWnEredEP.gif?height=238\\u0026width=401)\\n\\nThe first online services launched in the 1980s, long before there was commercial access to the Internet. These services offered text-based UXes for chat, bulletin boards, stock quotes and other content but, for the most part, users could only ‘email’ with other users of the same service. Once the Internet became generally available in 1992, online services like DELPHI, Compuserve and Prodigy (most of which had merged and mutated by this time) became a key way, along with independent ISPs, for users to access this much larger world. They enjoyed modest success. \\n\\nAmerica Online was the breakthrough. With a lineage dating to 1983 — providing games for the Atari, later the Commodore 64, then partnering with Apple on an online service — by the early 90s, the company had determined a strategy. It would be the easiest way for non-technical people to get online. In retrospect, this decision, which led to all of America Online’s subsequent (extremely ambitious) product design and marketing tactics, seems like an obvious choice. But it only does so if you assume the Internet is a mass market product that needs a mass market on-ramp. It was not at all unreasonable at the time to assert the opposite: that the Internet was a powerful tool for specialized and/or eccentric users (ham radio was a common comparison), and that the distribution strategy should reflect that. It was reasonable to believe that it could not or should not be made easy or that this was only possible to a limited extent. \\n  \\n America Online took the other side of that bet -- even at the risk of looking stupid or antagonizing the small but ideologically-committed existing community of Internet users. Whenever it was possible to eliminate a step in the onboarding process, they did. When the brilliant marketer Jan Brandt recognized that limited access to America Online’s software was inhibiting growth, she led [the most audacious disk distribution campaign in history](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/how-much-did-all-of-those-aol-cds-cost/68600/). “At one point, 50% of the CD’s produced worldwide had an AOL logo on it. We were logging in new subscribers at the rate of one every six seconds.” Then, in 1996, they went farther and got the software pre-loaded into Windows 95. When the company’s testers determined that users needed buttons to look like buttons, every important UX control was given bevels and drop-shadows, and design aesthetics be damned. Internet concepts like ‘BBS’ and ‘gopher’ were never invoked by name. Trusted content brands were promoted via well-known metaphors like ‘channels.’ \\n\\nUnderneath the design and marketing, everything was optimized for performance and user engagement. America Online built out a massive 1-800 network, so users’ modems would always be able to find an open phone line. They preloaded massive amounts of graphics on those ubiquitous disks, so that users wouldn’t need to wait for images to load. Ted Leonsis, whose company Steve Case acquired in 1994 and who led many of these moves, once said: “I spend most of my time dumbing things down.” There’s no more famous and appropriate example than the audio that rewarded users who logged back into the service again and again. In three simple words, it proclaimed the payoff: “You’ve got mail!”\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyUwDjgn_wmMf6l1YJLsV.png?height=383\\u0026width=612)\\n\\nThese moves worked. From 1993 to 1996, America Online rocketed from only 300,000 subscribers to 8 million. For the first time in the history of the Internet, a company had achieved ‘scale.’ Its slogan, “So easy to use, it’s no wonder it’s #1,” was accurate. When it launched a browser, AOL.com became the [biggest website](https://slate.com/technology/2009/02/the-unrecognizable-internet-of-1996.html) (by far), not because there was anything interesting on it, but because it was the default. And then, in what amounted to the *coup de grace* to the online services industry, America Online switched to all-you-can-eat pricing. (The flat fee was so popular that it overwhelmed the company’s modems, leading states attorneys-general to force AOL to take down the ‘Jetsons’ ad that promoted the deal.) By 1998, America Online was able to buy its remaining competitors, even including Web pioneer Netscape. America Online’s vision -- ease of use, at all cost -- had won.  \\n  \\n To what extent are we now, in the popularization of blockchain technology, at an ‘America Online moment?’ For consumers, the difficulty of participating in crypto services is certainly similar to the Internet of the early 90s. Two exceptional companies stand out as being easy enough to recommend to non-crypto friends: [Dapper](https://www.google.com/search?q=dapper+labs\\u0026rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US959\\u0026oq=dapper+labs\\u0026aqs=chrome..69i57j46i199i433i465i512j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.2288j0j9\\u0026sourceid=chrome\\u0026ie=UTF-8) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). But we are very much still in a pre-consumer phase of Web3. While there are games emerging (see: [Axie](https://axieinfinity.com/)), and pockets of user attention in corners of Web3 tied to particular interests, there remains a massive non-technical gap in comprehension and onboarding. Most practical use cases are narrow in appeal, like digital sports collectibles and coin/token investing. The value of America Online was driving user onboarding in a way that showcased what the internet could unlock across a variety of interests and industries. Blockchain protocols and products today lack that user onramp. Bottom line:\\n\\n\\u003e **There’s no single America Online-style solution that gets the newbie simple and comprehensive access to the best of the blockchain.**\\n\\nTo this claim, we can expect protests from both crypto skeptics and enthusiasts. The skeptics would argue that the analogy makes no sense, at least not yet, because there’s no crypto value proposition as useful as email, instant messaging or web browsing. From this perspective, it doesn’t matter how easy you make accessing ‘the blockchain,’ if for most people there’s no imminent imperative to do so. On the other side, enthusiasts might argue that onboarding problems are being slowly but surely solved by the crypto community, and that no dramatic simplification, no ‘dumbing down’ from outsiders, would ever work. The nature of decentralization, after all, rejects attempts at singular solutions. Dumbing down has always necessitated the transfer of sovereignty from the user to the platform. \\n\\nThese opposing points, perhaps paradoxically, both ring true. And it's not difficult to see how they might interact to constrain the market. Decentralization leads to difficulty of use which leads to a relatively small number of tech-savvy crypto users which in turn leads to a limited number of use-cases. And, in a context entirely *unlike* the early Internet, the vast amount of money sloshing around the blockchain compounds this ‘problem.’ To put another way, it’s lucrative for crypto developers to provide services for the small number of comparably wealthy and sophisticated users already onboard. They don’t need to solve getting newbies ‘onchain’ to be profitable.\\n\\nSo it’s interesting to consider what the Steve Case, Ted Leonsis and Jan Brandt of today would build on the blockchain. To begin with, we can be fairly confident that it would focus on NFTs. Why? Because even though we’re early in its development, it is already evident that collecting and trading ‘things’ is more compelling to mainstream users and more adaptable to everyday life than abstract ‘currencies.’\\n\\nImagine a service organized around categories, like hobbies, sports, health and so on. In each category, there would be products users could purchase, though lots of them would be ‘freebies,’ mostly from brands that users recognized, like fashion houses, film and video game franchises, sports teams and cooking shows. These would range from digital services, like a paid podcast or Q\\u0026A helpline, to a physical thing, like shoes or cookware, or tickets to an online or real-life event. These would all be items in NFT collections, although the platform might be called something else. When users bought one, they would have access to a community of other people who also owned them. Imagine buying a piece of exercise equipment and having access to a chat room, message boards, and community events, populated by the company and its fans. All of the NFTs a user owns would be  organized in her/his profile (wallet). They would be default private but users could choose to make them viewable to friends. If they were physical/real-world products, users might choose to redeem them for delivery, in which case the NFT would become a stub for returns. Users might choose to sell their NFTs, if they lost interest in the product and/or if the prices for them increased in value, and this would be easily managed through the interface. Most importantly, users would receive notifications of products they would be likely to want to buy or trade for, all based on the contents of their profiles. \\n\\n[https://www.edge.org/conversation/ted_leonsis-digerati-chapter-18](https://www.edge.org/conversation/ted_leonsis-digerati-chapter-18)\\n\\nToday, much of this is slowly happening within an increasingly large community of crypto-curious. The AIM screen name is being [replaced with PFPs](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/pfp-nfts-future-market-1234602384/). Chat rooms have migrated beyond communication centers to be coordinated businesses between community members by way of DAOs. Purchasing is made ‘simple’ through wallets, and offers an interoperable experience for being able to buy and hold across the entire internet. And purchase power is put in the hands of the originators themselves, setting rules on price and contracts for secondary markets to build a business around virality and recirculation. You can argue these early attempts on social structures and community were driven by influence of the AOL days, but lean heavily on the ability to do this everywhere rather than just a specific somewhere. But this is an entirely new internet. For decades we’ve assumed that online items were less valuable than physical ones, and internet participation was more about connecting the physical to the digital and managing your physical life online. With NFTs, that responsibility has changed. Not only has the digital world been completely untethered from the physical world, but we are now able to actually LIVE online. America online is now online America. And this change is significant. \\n\\nThe America Online of Web3 would break down this new value in every single way. Similarly to how the Web2 conveniently showed “normies” the functions of a consumer internet, there needs to be coordinated efforts to unveil the utility of the next internet. Note that it won’t be the decentralized, chaotic, high-risk but high-fun world of the current crypto-verse. It would only feature collections that the service considered reasonably priced and scam-free. It might even provide unhappy buyers with money-back guarantees! \\n\\nThe team behind such an effort would be relentlessly attacked by the crypto community as security risks and ‘centralizers’ -- both of which might actually be true -- even more than Steve Case, Jan Brandt and Ted Leonsis once were. And the hyper-rapid development cycles and attention deficit tendencies of crypto makes it difficult to create something integrated and comprehensive which doesn’t feel anachronistic by the time it launches. We’ll probably see elements of the concept in bits and pieces, perhaps from mega-platforms like Facebook, Amazon and Apple, rather than as a standalone single offering. And it’s possible that the success of such a platform would be short-lived anyway, like the bicycle training wheels a kid finds cumbersome, even embarrassing, within a few months.\\n\\nBut the need right now is real. Is there any path to rapid scale? Is there an analogy to the tidal wave of 3.5-inch floppies that found every tech-laggard in America and got them an email address? Is anyone thinking big enough? We believe we should try.\\n\\n \\n  \\n \",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"XdzGaKgCMXmm7Xgaai_u4-iv7MCjF025sip_TJSDrVo\",\"timestamp\":1636395377,\"title\":\"America Onchain: \\\"You've Got Scale?\\\"\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\",\"address\":\"0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a50b6785-1a70-493e-9803-052c753b5337.jpeg?height=1041\\u0026width=1040\",\"description\":\"Non-Fungible Incentives For Open Innovation\",\"displayName\":\"Planck Manuscripts\",\"domain\":\"s.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"p1anck.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"ORANGE\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\",\"address\":\"0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee6df49e-7d8a-4530-8397-a87d062c8ae9.png?height=250\\u0026width=250\",\"description\":\"Weekly musings on web3\",\"displayName\":\"Jamm Session\",\"domain\":\"jammsession.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"flynnjamm.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"BLUE\",\"colorMode\":\"DARK\"}},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\",\"address\":\"0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\",\"avatarURL\":null,\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Tal\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"address\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a3ef6b7-0ab8-4fe0-a60f-6cd171849e49.jpg?height=3088\\u0026width=2316\",\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Jonathanglick\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xc8f8e2F59Dd95fF67c3d39109ecA2e2A017D4c8a\",\"address\":\"0xc8f8e2F59Dd95fF67c3d39109ecA2e2A017D4c8a\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b512577a-2bd8-40ef-b7bc-2f3b139e1af0.png?height=1020\\u0026width=1020\",\"description\":\"\",\"displayName\":\"Visualize Value\",\"domain\":\"vv.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"visualizevalue.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"FOREGROUND\",\"colorMode\":\"DARK\"}}],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM\",\"body\":\"![by Javier Grixo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wHYtd75UhuVy9l1HlSKkt.jpg?height=3239\\u0026width=4858)\\n\\n\\u003e “When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” - Steve Jobs\\n\\nWe do these things…\\n\\n\\u003e “…not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” - John F. Kennedy\\n\\nLet’s begin with some facts.\\n\\n‘Centralization’ isn’t failing or fatally flawed. Centralized products and platforms are popular and successful. Centralization provides users with convenience, incredibly low prices, comprehensive directories and marketplaces, and just about everything else we associate with compelling innovations. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Apple, and Twitter are all examples of fantastically successful centralization that provides value every single day.\\n\\nBut centralization absolutely *does* limit the number of big ‘winners.’ The omnipresent power law skews value relentlessly to the top. We see this across top companies, investors, creators, influencers and beyond. The more centralized the platform or business, the more this tendency proves true.\\n\\nSo the real argument for crypto, and more broadly decentralization, is *not* that centralized systems are broken. Or that the current business models of the internet are not working. Because, in fact, they *are* for most consumers and many tens of thousands of creators. It’s that they are *so* functional that only a radical redistribution of control and ownership could wedge new opportunities to create more equity. It’s an attempt to counterbalance the massive ‘power law effects’ of these centralized systems.\\n\\nHere’s how it works, at least in theory:\\n\\n“Hey, Ms. or Mr. Developer or Creator or User, we are really worried about centralized systems. We’d like you to help us build alternatives. But we also know that you *not* using or working on those super-successful centralized things is a cost to you, and that developing these decentralized alternatives is going to be hard to pull off, so we’re going to make you an amazing once-in-a-lifetime offer. We will architect this whole new alternative system such that you will actually earn and/or buy inexpensive ‘shares’ and get a meaningful voice in what might just maybe be the next biggest thing. Maybe the biggest thing ever. And so, if and when all this does actually happen, you’ll be one of the big winners. We promise. And we don’t just *promise*. We’ll put it in a (smart) contract.”\\n\\nCrypto is a direct, maybe even desperate, financial and emotional appeal to shift your ass from passive consumption to active collaboration.\\n\\nNow, a gambit this great *only* makes sense if you believe in the massive self-perpetuating appeal of centralization. The competitive disadvantages of decentralization are so immense that it only works if the offered incentives (economic, cultural) outweigh those disadvantages. Which is why the incentives are a historically unprecedented amount of money and status. Think of it like the biggest XPRIZE in history, being offered to everyone on the planet.\\n\\nBut it should be noted, this incentive system *does* lead to a signaling problem. To keep people motivated to believe, work hard and spread these decentralized environments, it’s very helpful that the prices of the shares (ie., tokens, etc) and that triumphant vibe within the culture — all plausible evidence of the potential size of the prize and our progress towards it — continue to grow. And when we engineer the incentives correctly (tokenomics, ftw!), they do. The problem is that we have this natural mental association that assumes that when prices go up, when people get famous, and when huge sums of money are raised that means that the new thing is already working.\\n\\nBut in this case, that’s only partially true. It’s *true* that the incentive system is working, that people are flocking, that we’re getting artists and developers paid, that there’s a great feeling of community and commitment, and that there’s a growing awareness and interest from folks on the outside. But it’s not necessarily true that decentralized technology is working particularly well as a feasible replacement for those centralized competitors. At least not yet or any time soon. After all, as we know, the problem is incredibly hard. We wouldn’t be attacking centralization in this insane way if it wasn’t.\\n\\nAnd one of the specific consequences of the signaling problem is that it leads some people to underestimate the ability of the centralized systems to adjust. There's a natural assumption that successful systems get fat and lazy and that their processes become calcified and resistant to new information regarding threats. And after all, why would everything on the decentralized side be going up in value, if the competitor wasn't ripe for the killing?\\n\\nBut that assumption, that centralized systems don’t know what they’re doing, is delusional. These tech companies are fucking smart. They are led by nimble (and paranoid) leaders, with a ton of money and other treats to hand out, who have no problem understanding the importance of disrupting themselves (see Facebook). If their ‘number of winners’ problem gets too noticeable and acute, there’s a lot of tuning they can do, both symbolic and real, to adjust and make the situation look a lot better. And, here’s the kicker: it’s especially easy for them to co opt the user-friendliest features of decentralized culture to make themselves more popular. Not only that, but the incentive-seeking folks on the decentralized side will be overjoyed that they are being embraced by the big centralized companies (see Twitter verifying NFTs!). Because it increases the value of their ‘shares.’\\n\\nSo, given how daunting the challenge actually is, let’s ask ourselves again: Is centralization *really* as dangerous as those of us on the Web3 side believe? Does it lead inexorably to oligopoly, censorship, and the constraint of innovation? And if so, do those risks outweigh the difficulties and disadvantages posed by the blockchain gambit? On this, reasonable people can disagree.\\n\\nBut any reasonable person would also admit that the competent and popular centralization of our current moment puts massive, historic, practically God-like powers in the hands of a few dozen men (basically, all men) and a few thousand of their execs. That’s a few thousand ‘big winners’ among billions of people. They are for the most part not subject to boards or shareholders. While one or two may stumble, it's hardly far-fetched that the current pantheon will remain more or less unchanged for decades to come. Our devices will get cheaper, our networks more powerful, and our online experiences more engrossing. The number of lives influenced by this small group will continue to increase. So will the power and subtlety of their influence.\\n\\nAnd any reasonable person would again agree that it is not some panicky conjecture that these few leaders will acquiesce to, even collaborate with, authoritarian governments and anti-democratic movements when they think it unavoidable, when it protects or extends their corporate power. Despite how rich all these folks already are, this is happening today, as a matter of normal business. If the realistic prospect of a technology like the Metaverse, deployed in partnership with dictators and demagogues doesn’t qualify as a danger, then there’s probably not much that concerns you.\\n\\nWill the ‘Hail Mary’ of crypto, with all of its chaos and con jobs, do a better job with these threats? Come on. Nobody knows. As much as the wild incentive system doesn’t necessarily mean it will work, it’s equally wrong to say that it *can’t*. The underlying structure of the Internet is decentralized. Open Source projects are decentralized. They work. But they also imperfect, and have left massive openings for centralized systems to address their gaps and limitations.\\n\\nBased on everything we know, the most likely outcome is one of partial success. Some additional and important functions of the communications, media and financial system will be taken over by reasonably decentralized protocols and governance. This will be accompanied by the spread of platforms that enable groups of creators and inventors to fund their growth without as much dependency on the centralized networks. And this will lead some of the centralized systems to adopt and co-opt the features and culture of the blockchain which in turn creates new opportunities and openings. A different group of people, hopefully many more of them, hopefully not mostly men or Western, and with different (perhaps not objectively better but fresh) aspirations, ascend to the echelons of hyper-influence. In other words, a somewhat more dynamic and democratic system.\\n\\nWe think it’s worth trying.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM\",\"timestamp\":1633346995,\"title\":\"Web3's

are entering the age of living online**. An increasing number of people have employment that exists only online. We have meaningful relationships that are primarily or even only online. It should not be surprising that a growing number of us -- especially we who are most intensely online -- are embracing the concept of ‘owning’ online things. A belief in the value of NFTs is a logical extension of the vitality of online experience and existence. \\n\\nAs with the ‘real world,’ the things we own enable important connections to other people. If we own related things, we may share similar personalities, interests or life situations. We may have a common vested interest in preserving or increasing their ongoing value. We may also be engaged in a kind of game with each other, competing to purchase more or more special versions of the item. We are bound together by economic commitments. \\n\\nThe archetypal example in the physical world is real estate. Where we live is a huge part of our identity and, usually, our net worth. By owning property in the same neighborhood, we have committed, at least to some extent, to a shared destiny. When we volunteer, for example, for an event or organization that makes the block a nicer place to live, when we organize or sponsor services that enrich the area, it enhances the value of everyone’s home. As the value of the neighborhood increases, we benefit together, both in terms of status as well as financially. As our relationships and sense of self become more embedded in the neighborhood, we become more attached to the property, deepening the connection and spurring active engagement. In healthy neighborhoods, all residents benefit from this ‘virtuous circle.’ Ownership leads to meaningful engagement which leads to increased desirability.. \\n\\nNFT collections, and especially the latest wave of ‘avatar communities’ aka PFP collections, have the potential to mirror this healthy dynamic. When we own a SupDuck or Cryptoad, we have a motivation to engage in behavior that makes everyone’s ownership more significant. As ‘residents’ of that virtual neighborhood, we all have an interest in broadening the list of ‘stuff you get’ as part of your NFT. And yet, the vast majority of these projects pay only lip service to that potential. The vast majority of projects offer only hand-waving assurances of future amenities. Rather than investing in genuinely valuable services for its community, the focus tends rather to be on shilling and stunts to generate FOMO. \\n\\nLet’s take a stroll down memory lane. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the mortgage bubble made home ownership more affordable. Builders responded by investing a lot of money to purchase land in areas that allowed for mass development of residential neighborhoods. There was so much money that developers built entire neighborhoods in the middle of nowhere with hopes of driving individual interest and eventual communities. Twenty five years later, some people still live there, some projects are completely torn down and one thing is for certain; none of them were built to last. These homes weren’t built in places that were convenient or around major metropolitan cities or downtowns driven by existing communities and culture, they were built where land was cheap. But people were like whatever. And eventually there was a huge market flippening in these spaces. \\n\\nMost of today’s Web3 virtual neighborhoods are following the history of the physical world’s McMansions; building 10,000 ‘homes’ in the middle of nowhere hoping people move in. The awareness that needs to take place in order to avoid a mass flippening is the approach Web3 takes to constructing neighborhoods. Instead of just finding land, developing homes and hoping community fosters through a shared space, developers need to invest in making sure individual buyers get value out of their experience. This means making sure that every single day, there is something happening in the community. NFTs communities can be awesome, we just need to start building shit inside of them. \\n\\n## A community first approach to neighborhoods. \\n\\nIn order for virtual neighborhoods to be long lasting, attention needs to move from owning space and land to developing robust services  within the areas where people live. If NFTs get you into the club, what happens once you’re in it? One likely way this question will be answered is to focus the collection community on a particular shared interest. When members share values, it becomes vastly easier to determine and develop the benefits that they will consider valuable. \\n\\nWhat sort of shared interests might be well-suited to token-communities? Unlike Web media, NFT communities are participatory environments. It’s not about passively consuming but actively participating with the content and community directly. Content takes on an entirely new role of creating virtual space, like physical space is a venue for cooperation and collaboration. So they can be smaller in total audience size than those required to support an ad-based business, provided the members’ commitment is sufficiently intense. So there’s no shortage of potential interests that might be addressed. \\n\\nCommunities can be built around professional networks, for example. Picture an NFT collection celebrating and welcoming designers or teachers or security experts. Another possible focus could be causes, like the climate crisis or free speech. We might also see cohesive communities around hobbies (fashion! surfing! hunting!) or fitness/wellness activities (crossfit! fasting! meditation!) \\n\\nBut we need to be realistic about the effort needed to create compelling experiences with these ‘neighborhoods.’.  Web3 communities need programming. In an era where NFT drops serve as a catalyst for community building, there is a tendency to hope that  individuals will  build the culture and activities of their collection This does happen but is probably insufficient for lasting value. The reason why traditional media has done a good job for decades of readership is that there is a content cadence that drives discussion, consumption and community engagement. But the real opportunity for Web3 to break out is the reverse incentive of the contribution of work. Today’s creators deal with a sort of volunteerism where the small percentage of individuals who do break through actually make money. Authenticity is lost in exchange for trying to grasp an audience, and free labor often results in… free content. But looking outside of the media to build Web3 communities is a catalyst for innovation, where content becomes the space for activities, participation and relationships. For example, in the physical world, SoulCycle has built an entire culture around physically working out but then digitally learning how to eat better and meet like minded individuals who want to live a similar lifestyle. Individuals reside in these “neighborhoods” because there is constant programming to keep them engaged and incentives to build the community up to better themselves and those around them. Purpose is driven through the development of content, and Web3 communities must proactively work to make the places where people reside a daily habit. It is important to invest in the ability for individuals to get value out of their experience, that every single day there is something happening. \\n\\nGood things cost money, and you can’t get valuable experiences without investing in the community to build them. A worthy investment for NFT projects is around education. A key value of communities and neighborhoods is that individuals are able to teach one another. We are starting to see this foster in Web3 through community driven discords, telegrams and WhatsApps but oftentimes, this is happening outside of the project owners themselves. Arguably, this is a feature not a bug as the community is free to build on top of the IP distributed by the origin creators but as we think about lasting value, there needs to be an incentive to cultivate contribution through shared learning from one another. This means that it should be instilled at a foundational level that then bubbles up through the community regardless of which platforms they are spending time with one another one. \\n\\n## Putting interests at the forefront of infrastructure. \\n\\nToday’s Web3 neighborhoods are mostly being built around financial interests. And the promise of getting rich does lure people to these neighborhoods---the 10,000 houses may well be occupied, at least for a while. But we’ve seen this play out IRL, with gold-rush Boomtowns from the 1800s becoming today’s Ghost Towns, having failed to attract real residents and establish a culture. Visit one of these places today and you’ll see they didn’t get much built beyond a saloon, a place to meet up and talk about finding gold. Visit the discord of a forgotten PFP project from July and you’ll see something similar--a now abandoned general chat, containing little but a discussion of prices and sales. \\\\n  \\\\n But there were exceptions--- some Boomtowns attracted families and developed a thriving culture, becoming San Francisco, Chicago, Denver. The great HBO show Deadwood is the story of how a historical Boomtown developed a culture and transcended the speculative interests that drew people to it in the first place. Its creator David Milch felt that a true society often starts with a “symbol agreed upon”. For Milch this can be a cross, but it can also be gold (or perhaps even drawings of apes.) And it’s that agreement that liberates individuals to participate and find their “identity in the collective.” For Milch, you can start with speculation but you can’t stop there. \\n\\nDeadwood posits that if a lasting culture is to form, it will be aided by spaces, artifacts, rituals, and symbols. And with NFTs and DAOs we might be seeing the emergence of the digitally native forms of these essential human primitives. But it’s up to these nascent Boomtowns to use them, with success being observed with the deepening the group’s interactions and the expansion of their interests and reach. Certainly beyond the narrow motives that drew people to them in the first place, but beyond crypto as well. \\n\\nOn the flipside, building for interest groups has its challenges that will need to be met. By building neighborhoods around a particular interest, we are deliberately constraining the market size which will slow down value and decrease speculation. It becomes a stabler, yet less exciting investment. Why it’s critical to incorporate both financial and societal interests to maintain the right balance.\\n\\nNew communities are emerging on the internet by way of NFTs, giving individuals an opportunity to stake land and foster community in designated spaces constructed through residential avatars. But the approach of building communities this way is fragile. With unlimited space online and a gold rush to occupy mass areas, builders are overlooking the need for community in exchange for ownership. And that method, while momentarily successful when individuals have money to spend, deconstructs in the long run. \\n\\nNFT communities today are rewarding individuals for buying land and naming the sub-development versus what should be the true promise of crypto which is rewarding individuals that make the neighborhood flourish. It’s not the local mortgage services or banks that make a strong community, it’s the artists, restaurants and families that do. Today’s Web3 communities are building neighborhoods to attract community versus building communities to foster neighborhoods. This needs to change. \\n\\n** \\\\n  \\\\n

post includes a visual Edition of the article by Jack Butcher. all proceeds go to the Mint Fund)\\n\\n*Long Term maximum value requires accepting  — even embracing — loss of control.*\\n\\nIn the 20th Century, media became an industrial product. This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford's Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.\\n\\nThe heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.\\n\\nUsing the growing power of the media and its advertising complement, marketing departments would endeavor to turn products into hits, and hits into sequels, series and ongoing successes. The experience was delivered and defined by the industries directly, with a clear line of responsibilities-- and influence -- flowing from the creators to consumers. This taxonomy of roles gave a lot of power to the producers, who monopolized both development and delivery of goods across all industries.\\n\\nThen came the Internet, and the first casualty of industrial-era media was the same sector that started it: *newspapers*. Newspapers got unbundled, which deconstructed their core business units and then remixing began. But instead of newspapers reintegrating the value into their business, challengers emerged by way of social networks and reintegrated an environment that spun away from industrial control, built on community created content. \\n\\n\\u003e This provided the blueprint of remixed culture; industry bundles, unbundled by business, remixed by community and reintegrated into new mediums of exchange.\\n\\nBut let’s bring it back one time.\\n\\nOver the centuries of its steady growth, publishing had realized the way to maximize revenues was to include as much as possible within its ‘package.’ For ad-based titles, that meant bundling in as much advertising of as many kinds as possible: display, coupons, fliers, classifieds. That’s how we got editions of Vogue that weighed over five pounds and runs of the Sunday New York Times with so many inserts it needed to be wrapped in plastic. But publishing on the Web made it possible to ignore all that paid content. A reader could come to a story through a link and, apart from a few banners, never even encounter the classifieds. Worse, other pureplay startups were actually better at rebundling in advertising than the publishers.\\n\\n*Music was next.*\\n\\nThe seeds were planted in the mid-1960s with the creation of the Long Play (LP). With this new technology, artists suddenly had a much broader canvas on which they could ‘paint’ their musical ideas. The most ambitious acts realized the potential and almost overnight transformed the purpose of pop. And the labels, after years of focusing almost exclusively on the single, recognized this bigger bundle could make them a lot more money. By the end of the 1970s, however, the album was struggling. Under pressure to produce enough content to fill two long sides, the quality had crashed and newer genres (Disco, Punk, Hip-Hop) had gravitated back to shorter formats. A cash cow was in jeopardy. The answer? CDs. For a while it worked very very well. The new bundle was less expensive to make but the labels were able to charge more for it. People even bought CDs to replace their vinyl favorites. Happy days, for the industry, were here again.\\n\\n*But then came file-sharing.* \\n\\nMusic fans had been ‘stealing’ and sharing music, of course, since the creation of the Philips home cassette recorder in the 1960s. Entire cultures, like Deadheads, grew up around the swapping of prized recordings. Mixtape making became a passion for millions of fans. But it had never been a threat to the industry before. By 2001, the ever-increasing cost of CDs, the low killer/filler ratio of the bundle, and the superpowers of the Internet coincided to create the perfect storm. \\n\\nSuperfans took desires into their own hands. If they weren’t able to buy and trade music the way they wanted, they were going to take control of both the pricing and experience. This revolution changed the fan and artist relationship as we knew it, forcing an industry stuck on its laurels and business models into the internet age. It was chaotic, near fatal, and left much of the businesses history up to that point in its wake. But it forced an entirely new business around relationships and IP and evolved to a model that was a creative unlock for fans, labels and artists alike leading to an eventual restabilization. \\n\\nNapster was just an early first step in the move towards the new creator to fan model but it was the moment where the industry admitted that the audience is ultimately in control. IP could be adjusted, manipulated and remixed. It ushered in a new age.\\n\\nAcross media, this technologically mediated process has led to the unbundling, rebundling, remixing and then reintegration of content and IP. Traditionally, IP has been a one way process; a creator of IP licenses to another party and it goes down the assembly line. But thanks to technology that’s changed. Today media is increasingly dominated by decentralized IP that takes a different approach, one that presents a multi-directional relationship between fan and creator. And when we talk about remixing, it’s not just about re-imagining third-party material. It’s about creating entirely new work. \\n\\n***These Are The Good Times***\\n\\nThere’s no precise moment to mark the beginning of the remix era. But it’s important to recognize that one reason shorter form vinyl came back into popularity by the end of the 1970s was not only because the album had become a bloated mess of throwaway tracks; it was because club DJs had figured out how to take R\\u0026B songs and make them into something amazing. And they did it live. They played songs with great hooks, and to keep their audiences dancing and happy, figured out how to use the turntable to drop back and keep the party going. This wasn’t a new song exactly, but it was a longer version of it. \\n\\nPretty soon, labels who wanted their artists promoted in discos came out with special versions of songs with longer dance sections, or breakdowns. This led directly into the next innovation, the seamless merging of one song with the one that followed. The aim was to never let the dance floor get empty. So the best figured out how to time the transition just right such that it created one continuous flow of melody. There would be this wonderful moment at the merging point where the two songs played over each other, making something recognizable and yet novel. Rap emcees added one more layer on top, taking the Jamaican toasting style and James Brownian braggadociousness, now creating something lyrical and truly original. \\n\\nIt’s probably not an accident that the musical breakthrough of hip hop resembled the layered effect of New York graffiti, a palimpsest of different artists adding their own signature contributions. Not quite as criminal as tagging subway cars, but it existed outside the law. Not that anybody cared at first. The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records. And promptly got sued. Probably the most famous early example was ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ Layering their infectious phrases over a barely modified Nile Rodgers’ baseline, the Sugarhill Gang scored the first ever Billboard Hot 100 hip hop hit. Once Chic’s lawyers got involved, Nile and his partner Bernard Edwards were added as songwriters and the rest is musical history. Forty years later, hip hop is arguably the most popular genre in the world, and it’s all based on sampling. \\n\\n***On the Internet nobody knows you’re a blog***\\n\\nA similar remix process happened to news and written content more broadly. Now that newspapers and magazines had been unbundled on the Web, they, like singles in music, could be harvested for the creation of something new and created by end-users. \\n\\n‘User-created content,’ of course, is as old as the Internet, which was designed by and around research institutions with no inherent sense of professional versus amateur content. Anyone who had an account with access was a potential publisher. Creators took advantage of the freedom of the early Internet to write and share content on subjects they loved. Usenet and Gopher directories were bursting with original commentary and reviews of favorite shows and books, like Lord of the Rings, Dune and Star Trek. And the most original aspect of this geek creativity was fanfic, unauthorized new stories featuring beloved characters, often in transgressive romantic situations. \\n\\nThen came the Web, and for a while, the graphical/visual flavor of this new UX helped reassert the dominance of professional publishers. In the late 90s, every newspaper rushed to build websites and make distribution deals. Offline titles with their logos and photos, organized into the channels of ‘portals,’ all festooned with branded banners, seemed like a new normal. User-creators were herded into message boards, chat rooms and community features, below the fold, away from the ads. The professional content was the star of the show.\\n\\nBut it didn’t last long. The bubble popped, the portals crashed and the bottom-up energy of the Usenet came roaring back under the rubric of Web 2.0. It was a whole constellation of new technologies and ideologies but they crystallized in the concept of the weblog. \\n\\nBlogs began as a kind of online public diary — hence the name — but fairly soon, the most common purpose was public commentary, typically written around quotes from and links to news articles. Some blogs, like the Drudge Report, were like alternative versions of a newspaper front page, with the blogger playing the role of the front page editor, picking the most important stories from across the Web and rewriting the headlines. Others blogs would take one news article and deconstruct it, annotating and criticizing. All this was made possible, needless to say, because all those professional publishers had unbundled their content, at that time rarely behind subscription walls or even registration, directly on the Web. There was free and easy access to the underlying raw material. Blogs were remixing it and each other with captivating results. \\n\\nWe all know what happened next. The open APIs and protocols of blogging were swallowed up by the increasingly closed but increasingly viral feeds of social networks. Entirely new forms of visual communication, memes, with unique styles of humor and patterns of layered remixing, thrived, reaching millions within minutes, driving ‘engagement.’ What had been unbundled and remixed had suddenly become bundled again. Inside these massive algorithmic systems, creators were more powerful than ever and yet curiously also powerless. Publishers faced the same sort of dilemma. Without the amplification of the remixing influencers (as they came to be called), the media companies got no amplification. But all the unbundled content they pumped in only made the social networks stronger. We’ve been dealing with the consequences and ramifications on our cultural, political and social lives ever since. And it’s only accelerating. \\n\\n***The TikTokification of IP***\\n\\nSimilar to the music business in the hip hop era, it’s increasingly hard for today’s media companies to absolutely prevent developers, creators, fans and consumers from building on top of their IP. This is not new, and anyone walking through Times Square in Manhattan knows that Bumblebee or The Minions will work tirelessly to latch on to you, grab a selfie and chase you down for $10. More broadly, major media hits have long been remixed versions of existing IP. This has been happening in the games industry for decades where every major hit, from Counterstrike, to Fortnite, to League of Legends has been a user generated mod of an existing popular game and IP. But while it isn’t new, the pace of remixing is increasing, and the practical control IP owners have over their works is slipping and the social acceptance and in fact critical importance of remixing is only rising exponentially. \\n\\nLook no further than the rise of Tiktok. TikTok is the most important social network today for shaping culture and it is largely powered by a mass market remixing system unlike any we’ve ever had. In many respects, TikTok is the inevitable and natural conclusion of the memfication and socialization of content. If the medium is the message, then IP is the ink with which it's written. Users react, recreate, remix and redefine any and all IP in a massive algorithmically driven social experiment designed to take existing ideas, content, and formats, mash them together perhaps with a bit of something new, throw them at the wall, and see what sticks, only to scrape up what does and start the whole process over again.\\n\\nOf course the tiktokification of IP is happening everywhere. Its happening on Roblox with respect to games and virtual experiences, its happening on soundcloud with respect to music, its happening on Wattpad with respect to text. The catalyst for an industry to move from one-way to two-way IP relationships is the emergence of tooling that lowers the barrier of entry to engage with the IP itself. Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \\n\\n***A generation of reintegration***\\n\\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs. Over the next several years, it’s probable that every media company who owns popular characters, worlds and brands is going to enable users to collect these individual unbundled assets by owning them as tokens. The driving motivation for these IP businesses is not a preference for unbundling, of course. Like every other profit-maximizing organization, they understand the value of forcing customers to buy a larger package. But creative companies are operating within a media landscape that is dominated by a small number of even bigger bundlers, the social networks, streaming platforms and app stores. On all sides, opportunities for direct relationships with and uncapped revenue from end-users are drying up. In this context, the possibilities offered by NFTs are tantalizing: a near zero-cost product that can be sold and re-sold, perhaps for a considerable amount, without any disintermediation. And on the surface, it’s a model that looks almost exactly like merchandising, a business they know well.\\n\\nBut, as we’ve seen over and over again, regardless of why unbundling occurs, whether because consumers force it or producers embrace it (and it’s usually a combination), one result will always be remixing. When the atom of IP gets smaller and easier to handle, creative recombination -- a new molecule! -- becomes inevitable. And NFTs, like all blockchain elements and assets, are designed to be combined. So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\\n\\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \\n\\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \\n\\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \\n\\n***So where does that leave IP?***\\n\\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \\n\\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607\\u0026width=587)\\n\\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\\n\\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\\n\\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \\\"developable\\\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \\n\\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24\",\"timestamp\":1626792662,\"title\":\"Hip Hop, Blogs and NFTs: Unbundling, Remixing and Reintegrating Media (NFT Drop)\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":204,\"featuredImage\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaAssetType\",\"mimetype\":\"image/png\",\"sizes\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaAssetSizesType\",\"og\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaAssetSizeType\",\"src\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/nft/047eb458-1332-448b-b3ff-bbc21b8579f0.png\",\"height\":2160,\"width\":4320}}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\",\"address\":\"0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a50b6785-1a70-493e-9803-052c753b5337.jpeg?height=1041\\u0026width=1040\",\"description\":\"Non-Fungible Incentives For Open Innovation\",\"displayName\":\"Planck Manuscripts\",\"domain\":\"s.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"p1anck.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"ORANGE\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\",\"address\":\"0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee6df49e-7d8a-4530-8397-a87d062c8ae9.png?height=250\\u0026width=250\",\"description\":\"Weekly musings on web3\",\"displayName\":\"Jamm Session\",\"domain\":\"jammsession.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"flynnjamm.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"BLUE\",\"colorMode\":\"DARK\"}},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\",\"address\":\"0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\",\"avatarURL\":null,\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Tal\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null},{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"address\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a3ef6b7-0ab8-4fe0-a60f-6cd171849e49.jpg?height=3088\\u0026width=2316\",\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Jonathanglick\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null}],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\",\"body\":\"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19582697-172f-42a6-9955-769c2d6d8b2b.jpeg?height=900\\u0026width=1600)\\n\\nImplicit in the name ‘Web3’ is the expectation of replacement. In technology, versions are successors. When the new model comes out, we upgrade and the older one is replaced and forgotten.\\n\\nIs this what we mean when we refer to Web3? Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web2? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \\n\\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\\n\\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever. How many influencers have used their followers to make an easy leap into crypto sales? How many important projects have used social media to find and recruit contributors? Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \\n\\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web2 anyway?\\n\\n### What is actually wrong with Web2?\\n\\nIn 2004 “Web2” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web2 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \\n\\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\\n\\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \\n\\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\\n\\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \\n\\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \\n\\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \\nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \\n\\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \\n\\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \\n\\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators \\u0026 consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \\n\\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \\n\\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\\n\\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \\n\\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \\n\\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \\n\\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\\n\\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \\n\\nThere are three possible answers:\\n\\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\\n\\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\\n\\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\\n\\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \\n\\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \\n\\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\\n\\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web2 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\",\"timestamp\":1623952839,\"title\":\"Reputation in Web3: Ships Built on the Great Flood\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\",\"body\":\"a glick x tal x darkstar jam\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/70ada907-cd8c-40fc-8a13-813418b306c4.png?height=397\\u0026width=607)\\n\\nIf you walk the streets of any American neighborhood or town more than, say, 100 years-old, you’ll see ghosts. \\n\\nNot the ghosts of previous inhabitants, although that’s also possible. But the ghosts of the civic and religious organizations that were once the core organizing principle of American communal life. You can see them in the fading signs for men’s fraternities and women’s leagues that no longer meet, the labor halls renovated for restaurants and condos, and the community centers for ethnic and immigrant groups that have long since decamped for the suburbs. You can see those ghosts in the statues of beloved (often dubious) heroes that were erected by the regiments (or descendants) of veterans of various wars, the money painstakingly raised through membership subscription. Most of all, you can see them in the old churches, each for a subtly different but vigorous denomination, once the pride of their parishioners, now usually empty. \\n\\nIn his famous 1995 essay, “[Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital](http://mktgsensei.com/AMAE/Consumer%20Behavior/bowlingalone.pdf),” Robert Putnam chronicled the remarkable depth and diversity of the communal groups of the United States. Tracing the trajectory from the earliest colonists of the United States, he showed how Tocqueville’s observation that, “Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all minds” were “constantly joining together in groups,” was even more true following the waves of immigration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These newcomers, faced with difficult circumstances and often hostile neighbors, banded together for mutual support and status. They paid their dues, sat on committees, went to banquets, and advocated for collective causes. And because even long-settled Americans were migrants as they moved West, similar ‘joining behaviors’ spread to the newer cities and towns. \\n\\nBut beginning with the end of World War II, this trend began to sharply reverse. Secularization, smaller families, the automobile and new housing patterns, changing professional expectations, the rising equality of women and the impact of television are all likely causes. The Baby Boomers drove massive social movements, but they didn’t join voluntary membership associations, organizations and churches like their parents and grandparents did. And their kids even less. \\n\\n\\u003e The effects have been profound.\\n\\nAmerican communities founded on intense associational activity now have a civic participation vacuum. Associations once mobilized their constituents for specific improvements but now only local governments -- often elected by tiny numbers of voters, or self-appointed small business groups -- serve as public custodians. While there have always been good reasons for certain groups of Americans to fear and distrust the government, the lack of faith or even interest in our local institutions is now universal. It’s so endemic we don’t notice it. It’s hard to imagine how it might be different.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, we hear reminders concerning the importance of local newspapers and media. Opinion pieces shout about how communities facing political corruption or economic collapse are helpless without journalistic watch-dogs. But this is asking far too much from a newspaper. The problem is vastly deeper. Even when enterprising reporters uncover local scandals or promote essential reforms, it is clear that without well-organized, funded and representative citizen groups, there’s almost no effect. *Financial support for local media without a revolution in civic engagement is probably pointless.*\\n\\nBut is a revolution in civic engagement, even a small one, possible? We think so. Especially if we start small and focus on issues of relevance to people’s daily lives. And we think smart contracts and token ownership will ultimately play a decisive enabling function, block by block. \\n\\n**A New DAO: Local ~~News~~ Services**\\n\\nLet’s imagine something much smaller than a city, smaller than a neighborhood. An activity whose purpose is to bring the community together in a participatory manner in order to drive value, civic engagement and trust: the street fair. \\n\\nIn this scenario, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is formed for a particular street or business district. All participants in the fair ‘zone’ are awarded tokens by proving that they’re residents of the community (ie. a real address, or some other verification, a certain number per adult, a certain number per kid). Everybody automatically gets more every week. And like many DAOs, residents also earn more tokens for doing listed service actions. \\n\\nMerchants would rent booths from the DAO on a competitively auctioned basis. Community members would be rewarded in cash or tokens for helping out The Fair, like setting up and taking down booths, picking up trash or providing entertainment. But community members would also receive tokens for DAO management tasks. These tasks are differentiated in that they are focused on influential decisions for community decisioning like screening and voting on proposals (mainly, which services are needed and what the payment is, what merchants are approved, etc.). \\n\\nAs the street fair (hopefully) becomes nicer and better attended, booth prices will rise -- after all, more visitors, more value to the merchants. Tokens could also be bought from other owners, but voting is proportioned using the [quadratic governance model](https://medium.com/eximchain/quadratic-voting-smart-contracts-powerful-governance-model-b8efa4ddeef1) - where additional tokens only provide decreasingly additional incremental voting power. If the model worked, more neighborhoods could adopt it. When there are enough street fair DAOs, an index fund could be created allowing investors to own a diverse basket of neighborhood fairs and generating more liquidity for token owners. Essentially, street fair DAOs turn streets into a community’s economic asset.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ad92527-53e6-49ae-a877-7503cd60587e.png?height=366\\u0026width=546)\\n\\n**But why do we need tokens or a DAO to do any of this?**\\n\\nThese are all things that local non-profits already manage. At least in some places, it’s true that in some ‘healthy’ communities, existing institutions can run and grow successful events. But the management and organizational ‘overhead’ of traditional associations often exceeds the will and ability of potential participants. If you’ve ever been part of a community or school group, you understand the often prohibitive burden. It’s not only the time commitment of planning meetings — it’s the social dynamics where a few very active members dominate and others are ignored and relegated to less important tasks. But by moving to a DAO model, these issues become easier. \\n\\nOne way to think about on-chain governance is that it combines many of the best aspects of online communities with those of more traditional organizations. Unlike local associations, local message boards, chat rooms and Nextdoor or Facebook Groups allow citizens to share their opinions. People can do this at any time without leaving their homes, and with the comfort of anonymity if they choose. And unlike an in-person meeting, users can be involved in only the specific issue they find motivating, instead of having to sit through an entire meeting on a variety of topics (including the always delightful adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting.)\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the drawbacks of online communities for local organizing are significant and familiar. The low barrier to entry, the anonymity, the ease of interaction all leads to trolling and flame-wars, often over the smallest of disagreements. The lack of organizational structure leads to talk without action. Even when an online community does sprout real-world activity, the manifestation tends to be disorganized, diffuse and difficult to sustain.\\n\\nDAOs have strong answers to both sets of problems--\\n\\n- **traditional, in-person organizations**: smart contracts motivate participation by rewarding broader engagement, utilize online asynchronous interaction modes, and automate much of the drudgery of group decision-making. (You don’t need to approve the minutes for a blockchain-based entity.)\\n- **online communities**: DAOs add the structure necessary for determining real-world action and the real money, the practical means of aggregating and allocating it, to fund that action in the real world. (Chat rooms don’t have bank accounts.)\\n\\nSo let’s now zoom one step out. In addition to something like a street fair, other local entities might also issue tokens, from loyalty programs for small businesses, to support systems for parks and schools, to membership NFTs for performance spaces, to community-run traffic safety projects to anti-corruption campaigns. An active citizen might own tokens in dozens of local efforts, some in which they are a major participant, others in which they are more a casual observer. We can see how owners would work to market their projects to each other. We can imagine an entire ‘stock market’ for a city, asset prices reflecting the growth and success of different communal projects and efforts. We can envision how such liquidity dynamics would dramatically reduce the ‘cost of capital’ for any local ‘social’ entrepreneur and venture.\\n\\nIn this context, the mission of local news and information takes on an entirely new dimension. Instead of holding it responsible for all civic failures, the local news site becomes a portal to projects. Here could be hosted reviews of their progress, and perhaps even the marketplace where the tokens are promoted, tracked, bought, sold and traded. And of course, that local news site would itself be collectively owned, organized as a DAO and managed via tokens. \\n\\n*Consider how significant this change would be*. The newspaper emerged in the context of intensely active civic associations and local enterprises. It both reported on those organizations, including their many disputes, and acted as one itself. Small towns and immigrant communities alike supported thriving news concerns. Their pages were filled with advertisements and articles about community events and causes. Every dot on the railroad map had a local paper. At one point in the early 20th Century, New York City had six competing Yidddish dailies. The Statue of Liberty itself was a newspaper fundraising campaign. But as civic engagement declined, and as a response to the media's most dominant business models, the newspaper departed from its natural focus and pushed towards scale. It had to compete with television. More scale meant a broader focus on the content itself (outside of the community) and a larger opportunity to monetize through advertising or subscriptions. But it backfired. \\n\\nWhy? Because scale is the antonym of local. It’s the opposite. A scaled approach means removing community needs and participation from the forefront of value, which means an emphasis of *reporting on* communities versus *reporting of* those communities. Business models drive product strategy, and while we can’t retroactively return to how the local newspapers used to be structured, we can introduce new models that will drive its evolution into the next phase of value, moving from news broadcaster to civic engagement funnel. \\n\\nAs a platform that was incentivized to drive healthy ownership and engagement in local efforts, the local news DAO would be constantly innovating new ways to drive awareness of the best projects and caution of the risky ones. As members of the DAO, token holders (community residents) of the news site would be empowered to make influential decisions as to what gets covered, where assets are attributed to and what information would best service the community at large. In this way, the news site and the underlying civic associations become a virtuous circle, interest driving ownership and thus more engagement.\\n\\n**But are these innovations enough to reverse the decades-long decline of local civic associations?**\\n\\nYour answer to that question depends on what you believe to be the source of that decline. We look back with amazement at the sheer number of local associational relationships our grandparents and great-grandparents had, their involvement with churches and synagogues, with charities, lodges and clubs, commitments that occupied vast amounts of their time and lasted their whole lives. But this actually understates how differently earlier generations saw their place in the world. For them, especially if they were immigrants, there was no ‘choosing’ to be part of these communities. Their belonging was an unchanging fact of reality as they understood it. They couldn’t opt-out. The only question was how selflessly and successfully they would participate. \\n\\nFor most Americans today, this worldview is unimaginable. In their 2010 paper, [The Weirdest people in the world?](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.proquest.com/openview/196dc885b5d6d0ac0f53ac71b45caf76/1?pq-origsite%3Dgscholar%26cbl%3D47829\\u0026sa=D\\u0026source=editors\\u0026ust=1622635032822000\\u0026usg=AOvVaw3Tbe9TmXyDwlyRBLBjvrBi), Joseph Henrich, Ara Norenzayan and Steven J. Heine described how Western social scientists have routinely under-estimated how unusual modern American psychology is compared to the rest of the world. Using the acronym ‘WEIRD’ (Western, educated, industrial, rich and democratic), they noted how a whole corpus of psychology tests once believed to reveal universal human traits, having used American college students as their test subjects, were actually unique to specific Western populations. Now seen in contrast to tests done with Asians or Africans, it became evident how contemporary Westerners ground their worldviews in the radical notion of the individual. Subsequent experiments revealed how immigrants to the West transition from the ‘traditional’ communal or tribal perspectives to this WEIRD psychology within one or two generations. From these discoveries, it seems clear that our great-grandparents brought their communal orientation with them, from their home countries, and the great flourishing of ‘joining’ that Tocqueville described and that Putnam documents was their adaptation of belonging within the relative freedom of American society. We see the same behavior, that expectation of community commitment, among many new immigrants today.\\n\\nUnlike them, however, most of us are truly WEIRD. We cannot go back to a time when our families and our neighbors assumed evenings and weekends would be spent on communal efforts. For good or bad, we begin with the primacy of the person. And any cleareyed revival of civic life needs to be based in that reality. DAOs do that. You aren’t presumed to be obligated to engage -- you’re paid to. You aren’t a parishioner or adherent -- you’re an owner. You have an emotional connection to a collective mission -- but it’s framed in explicit economic self-interest. You don’t belong to a DAO — *it belongs to you*. \\n\\nInspired by the potential of these concepts, crypto-dreamers are [envisioning](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), in their WEIRD way like the pioneers of earlier centuries, entirely new cities based on smart contracts and tokens. Some talk about designing their new towns ‘in the Metaverse first,’ then raising money to build them in the real world, usually in some state or country hospitable to libertarian ideals. These visions are thrilling and important, but there’s just as much relevance for blockchain in the cities and towns that exist today. It’s possible the often disastrous record of new cities based on utopian ideals recommends we seek to solve the pernicious problems we already have rather than create new ones from scratch. It’s very likely that the totally new and the rebooted city will inform each other, like a testnet and a mainnet. In any case and in any setting, these crypto-local concepts -- and the tools to support them -- will take a long time to perfect. It will take a lot of failures before we begin to make progress, so we should begin right away. Just as the civic associations of our grandparents took centuries to rise and fall, blockchain-based organizing will require generations to evolve into a perfected and stable form. All those ghosts peer at us from the past, waiting for us to get started, remaking our cities.\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\",\"timestamp\":1622631806,\"title\":\"Cities of Ghosts Await Their DAO Revival\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\",\"body\":\"*a [flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) x [glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) x [tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [dicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) joint *\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/576dfd5e-59cf-480b-a05d-df015d40216f.png?height=918\\u0026width=610)\\n\\nIn the morning, you’re picking crops on the farm. By afternoon, you enter the arena to do battle. This isn’t a remake of the movie Gladiator. It’s one Anon’s day in the world of crypto games. As DeFi, NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies compete for mindshare, the entire crypto world is not only borrowing heavily from game mechanics but increasingly becoming a single massive integrated game itself. This is the inevitable result of user sovereignty. Interoperable protocols provide the freedom to move between thousands of dapps and blockchains, so developers are leaning into gamification in order to put a leash on existing users and keep them coming back for more. \\n\\nGame designers are, of course, experts in terms of keeping people engaged for long periods of time, even more than social media companies. Where social media companies have a recurring strategy to get someone to engage and then keep them engaged (ie. monetizing their attention through ads), games are different. Games look to draw you in at an initial (often free) engagement, but then encourage you to build status and identity within the experience itself. Mapping all this to crypto is easy. The users make purchases (see: NFTs) that make your social involvement (see: social tokens) unique. The experience blends intrinsic and extrinsic incentives to keep you invested (financially \\u0026 socially) in the experience itself.\\n\\nDespite this focus on gamification however, crypto games continue to struggle with designing exciting game mechanics that both drive long term engagement and live up to the decentralized and democratic ideals of the blockchain. Even the most popular games such as CryptoKitties and Top Shots have fairly similar bell-shaped curves in terms of transaction volumes and DAUs. We see significant concentration with limited adoption by broader groups participating at a fairly skewed playtime.\\n\\nWhy is this? Well, for the most part, cryptogames are borrowing pay-to-win and other non-meritocratic game mechanics instead of building the accomplishment loops that drive user/player delight, long-term engagement and mass adoption. They reward power users and big spenders, leading to a cycle of ‘rich getting richer.’ All this is based on non-skill-based mechanics that reward wallet size above all else. For example, users who buy rich assets are granted future potential benefits (more inflation, more exclusive opportunities to purchase in early sales) leading to them getting richer and putting themself further ahead. That’s not to say there aren’t success stories -- nor opportunities for skill, hard work and grinding to be rewarded -- but until the ecosystem learns to adapt the best of games, by rewarding all kinds of human capabilities, it cannot reach its full potential.\\n\\n**Cities \\u0026 Culture**\\n\\n[In Economic Flows \\u0026 Cultural Products](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI), we discussed how the path of protocol and creator (ie. DAOs) adopting will mirror the growth of culture in our first cities. That is to say, culture and creation via patronage and communal backing. Ironically, games were one of the first major applications and products built by crypto enthusiasts looking to drive greater adoption and mass participation in their new decentralized economy. In 2018, many of the biggest NFT marketplaces (OpenSea and Bitski) went all-in on crypto games as many proclaimed they were the future of crypto adoption and that crypto was the future of gaming. \\n\\nThis made sense. Gaming was already one of the most popular activities in the digital world, with significant overlap between the crypto and gamer audiences. And looking at the example of both Facebook and mobile, it was evident how important the rise of platform-specialized games had been to the popularity of those platforms. On top of that, gaming seemed like a particularly perfect fit for decentralized technology. Players have long been used to purchasing digital goods and participating in digital economies, with a natural belief that games ought to allow players more freedom and control over their virtual possessions. Vitalik Buterin has credited Blizzard’s arbitrary destruction of his World of Warcraft Siphon Life Spell as impetus to create Ethereum. \\n\\nThree years later, despite all these efforts and focus, crypto games still haven’t seen anything like the viral adoption we saw within Facebook and mobile. Most remain much more like speculative investment vehicles than entertainment hits. And with high gas fees and challenges in scalability and infrastructure, the player ranks remain small and concentrated.\\n\\nThere are several reasons why crypto games haven’t scaled to mass adoption-- \\n\\n- **Platform**: platform issues remain rampant. Today there are high transaction costs and problems with scalability, problems that would be even worse if user bases and demand were bigger. Plus there are big ugly unavoidable questions regarding the benefits of decentralization to the high-twitch vivid environments many serious gamers demand. \\n\\n- “**Revenue**”: business models remain challenged and misaligned. Today the opportunity for game-makers to earn a SHIT-TON of money from sale of land and items leads them to maximize these types of products -- this can make the core of the game suffer from ‘asset inequality,’ an experience too expensive for entry-level players, and a sort of preening Yuppie-ness that isn’t that cool.\\n\\n- **Immersion**: there is insufficient immersion - the crypto-ness of the games (many are thinly veiled yield farming) and interoperability of assets across games into marketplaces reduces the game’s intensity and believability and its sense of place and escape.\\n\\nMore importantly though, crypto games are competing with DeFi itself and, in that, often losing. If the game is just thinly veiled speculation and/or yield farming, why not just do that with the thousands of fun tokens minus the game pretext? It may actually be simpler to play the purer version, and, with the addition of social media group behaviors, even more fun.\\n\\n\\u003e DeFi is a more accessible game than crypto games and the rules can’t be changed by any single entity. \\n\\nIt’s possible that, because the use of the blockchain for the trading of digital assets as NFTs is so obvious (and lucrative) that crypto game designers have missed the larger possibilities of decentralization. Rather than centering their communities on competitions of cooperation and creativity, we get shallow status contests and themed casinos. And incentives can be seriously mis-aligned. With crypto games, the original creator can mint more NFTs at any point which causes inflation. \\n\\nThere’s no question that videogames have a God-dictator that determines the story, controls the economy, and tries to create the best possible experience. This helps make the games more fun and playable by altering the “meta” and ensuring playability and balance. This authority may be camouflaged in games, but it's always there. And it is essential to how successful games work. DeFi, in comparison, is competing 'games' (blockchains and dapps) within a metagame (the game of token vs token), with nobody in charge, or perhaps lots of people in charge. In the world of crypto, everything and nothing is a game at the same time. \\n\\nIn many ways, the problems facing crypto games reflect the inherent tension between those aspects of a game that ‘want’ to be decentralized and those better or more easily accomplished by a centralized solution. The development and management of innovative gameplay experiences, complex storyworlds and game economies are simply easier in a centralized setting. New crypto users, with their need for fiat and customer service, make this problem even more acute. Perhaps the two most popular gateways to crypto, Coinbase and Dapper’s TopShots, accepted the need for a compromise, but it is often an uncomfortable synthesis. The disruptive capabilities and ambitions of crypto sit restlessly within a bounded environment, like a caged wild animal looking for its opportunity to escape and wreak havoc. How to bridge this gap? Everyone agrees, to use the most common example, that it would be awesome if Fortnite enabled you to buy and sell and use Fortnite stuff outside of Fortnite. But that stuff is only valuable because Fortnite is awesome, and that awesomeness is the product of a highly managed environment. That's not to say we will never build decentralized systems and governance for a thing like Fortnite. We can and will eventually have Creator DAOs that build and run worlds. But we're not yet very close to being able to do that. And until then, we will mainly have crypto games that are more DeFi than delightful, more on-ramp to the blockchain than an engrossing destination.\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\",\"timestamp\":1621528139,\"title\":\"Balancing the Meta: The Role of Games in a Crypto World\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\",\"body\":\"a [glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) x [tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) x dicker joint\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b8cd854-77f9-4bfd-a69f-ab68b08094d9.png?height=170\\u0026width=477)\\n\\nYou’re inspired. \\n\\nYou’ve read a bunch of articles, blog posts, and essays and suddenly see that blinding flash of realization.

You might tag them on Twitter. They might care a little. The links would mean incremental traffic, perhaps one or two sign ups to their personal blog or newsletter. The dopamine of being referenced would be nice too. But… that’s it.\\n\\nNow, there’s a different way to create — one that positions you to *build upon* those sources of inspiration. Instead of using links and tags, by minting your essay as an NFT, you can attribute it, socially and financially, on-chain, to the authors and articles that influenced you. Last Tuesday, the brilliant folks at Mirror introduced the notion of ‘splits.’ [To use their language](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw), splits are a native feature that let you route funds continuously to an unlimited number of Ethereum addresses, according to a set of percentage allocations. Splits can be used to share the revenue generated from a sale of an NFT with any set number of collaborators. You can specify that Jonathan should get 20% and Tal should get 40% and so on until 100% of the treasury is allocated. When money comes in, it programmably flows out based on these percentages. This is all handled by the smart contract. Trustless and public.\\n\\nBut another way to use splits, and the more systemically significant one, is to attribute your sources of revelation. As the Mirror team put it, “collaboration then extends to who inspired your idea and to what extent.” In this use-case, you specify that, say, Patrick Rivera contributed 7% of the inspiration, while Packy McCormick provided 4% and Sari Azout and Jad Esber did 12%. When revenue is generated by your NFT, they automatically get their cut. \\n\\nSplits take behaviors that used to be purely intrinsic and status driven (social cred) and make them financially extrinsic (social + economic cred). It evolves actions and concepts which are inherently viral by pairing them with an economic incentive. When someone gets attributed to an article, even if it’s not a lot of money in her wallet, it feels good. (Packy did it for us, and it felt awesome.) And when people feel good, they tend to want to keep feeling good and make others feel good; first, by creating more content that will inspire other people. But also by, in turn, attributing the people who have inspired their work. By paying it forward, by being a good member of the community of writers, by in effect ‘paying it backward’ and acknowledging what others have given them. Of course in doing so, they are more likely themselves to be attributed again.\\n\\nBut like any foundational change, this will not only impact the way we drive value from the finished product, but influence the creation of the product itself. Splits and other tools like them introduce a business model around the creation of content, going beyond existing methods that focus purely on post-publish production and distribution. This concept has the ability to drive a significant value change to foundational content creation because the financial flows can go much deeper than one level. This isn’t about changing surface level citations and crediting, but about fundamentally altering the entire production, ownership and funding model for digital content.\\n\\nOur friends from Mirror note, “because crypto allows economics to route between any smart contracts, split value can flow beyond just people to entities like... NFTs.” So when you attribute Sari and Jad’s essay, any revenue you generate can flow proportionally and pool in their NFT. And if they wanted, that pool could continue to flow, according to the attribution splits they in turn determined, into the NFTs that inspired their work. Of course, the same dynamic would occur if someone created an NFT that attributed your essay. Revenue starting at the top would flow all the way down to the foundational inspirations. What used to be hyperlinks and mentions now becomes a financial structure that helps strengthen and fund an entire ecosystem. NFTs and splits have finally given hyperlinks a business model.\\n\\nMatt Stephenson laid it out perfectly in his recent essay, ‘How the First Great Finding in Empirical Science Was Lost for Decades.’ Focusing on the potential for cascading attribution as a funding source for basic scientific research, he called it a ‘[Splitstream](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg).’\\n\\n\\u003e The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\\n\\n[Sari and Jad seize](https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0) on the significance of this flow for deep foundational work--\\n\\n\\u003e But what if your back-catalog wasn’t stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\\n\\nBut where does the revenue come from? How does the funding get into this proposed attribution system? What will power this new business model? Are people seriously going to buy essay-NFTs or other content NFTs like they buy Cryptopunks and Beeples?\\n\\nLikely not. At least not for every content format. While there have been a number of very successful sales of essay-NFTs, it’s just not a perfect fit for the medium. While very old and important books are valuable, essays don’t hold the same perceived store of value as art and collectibles. There isn’t an existing cultural tradition of selling, much less auctioning, written content in the same way. \\n\\nBut when we unpack the reason people are buying NFTs, we see three interconnected motivations: \\n\\n- **Identity**: a desire to be personally associated with a particular creation\\n- **Status**: an effort to support a particular creator, and thus be included in their future works\\n- **Equity**: a hope that the asset may generate profit if it increases in value\\n\\nAnd those motivations are relevant for every content format. So for revenue and funding of any content format, we just need to enable mechanisms that satisfy these motivations while being both ‘native’ and natural.\\n\\nFor writing, instead of outright purchasing an essay, there could be the notion of supporting the essay, of patronizing it. Suppose there are some finite number of support 'spots' for an essay. As a curator who admires an essay, I could purchase the privilege of being acknowledged as a supporter of it by embedding my name or DAOs name in the foundation of the UX. The support capital would flow into the NFT, and then out to the various splits of collaborators and attributors. In this way, I would also be the owner of my ‘spot’ and would be able to sell my ‘spot’ to someone else. I could perhaps even make a profit, as the essay’s place in the web of attribution becomes more established and better recognized.\\n\\nOf course, the list of essays a particular person or DAO supports would itself be a useful index and source of valuable notifications. By connecting with content in this way, the community acknowledges supporters as essential curators, establishing their reputation while providing  a venue for others to follow their selections. So splits have not only potentially created a new funding model for content but for curation as well.\\n\\nIsn’t there in this system an inherent ‘free rider’ problem? Why wouldn’t someone read all these essays without ever paying to support one? Why wouldn’t someone writing an essay borrow ideas without ever attributing them as his or her source of inspiration? The answer is that they could. Just as someone can ‘consume’ an NFT without owning one. But doing so puts that person outside the community of ideas, and less able to fully participate in its benefits. Someone who never supports is unlikely to be supported. Someone who never attributes is unlikely to be attributed. All of these actions are recorded on the blockchain, transparent and permanent. He can be a free rider, but his track record will make that obvious, just as someone who is a steady conduit for value will be known and rewarded.\\n\\nWhat we are really describing -- what Sari and Jad and Patrick and Brian are pointing us to -- is a composable architecture for ideas: NFT-essays building on each other, precisely as Jesse described, as [media legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301673263840534528). \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/691fc17f-5c33-484c-8caa-648cd8be982f.png?height=182\\u0026width=940)\\n\\nUnlike the current Web, where the game is capturing unwitting traffic and funneling it towards the companies paying us, this concept of composable ideas inverts that pernicious tendency. In a network of attribution, we aim to add to and acknowledge the work of others, intentionally driving economic and reputational value to instrumental work, precisely in order so that others will consider doing the same for us. In this system, we want others to build on what we have built. The result is an ever-climbing tower of creativity, where ideas flow up and gratitude flows down.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/122ce981-9847-490d-b201-83579877481d.png?height=680\\u0026width=660)\\n\\nNot all nodes in this architecture can be of equal influence. Some will be much more significant than others. There will be foundational content pieces that are the end-point recipients of the attributions of tens of thousands of other creations. There will be other content pieces that provide essential bridges and flows between seemingly separate topic-networks. There will be curators whose lists of proudly supported content make up the definitive canon on a particular subject and whose support funded the thinking that built a whole new field of investigation and invention. But it is an architecture that gives every individual creator a platform and culture in which their ideas can radiate if they are useful to others.\\n\\nSo this new graph isn’t about who you ‘friend’ or follow, but who you attribute, who you support, and who inspires and supports you. Not as social gestures, but inscribed in smart contracts that deliver economic benefits. Not as traffic driven, but as credit given. Is this a relevant model for every kind of content? Probably not. Like the rest of the ownership economy, the places where these concepts will have the most impact are those domains where a specific community perceives a great deal of merit. Blockchain-based attribution is unlikely to change the business model behind an ephemeral news story, product review or TV show summary. But it is also possible that it changes the way those markets can be served. In addition to the competitive scrambling to be the first and most viral Mandalorian recap, there may also be room for a community of writers, and of writers’ collectives (DAOs and multi-sig publications), who create more thoughtful and lasting criticism by building on and attributing each others’ ideas. The only question is whether there are readers and writers who value it.\\n\\nSplits, supports and attributions are the pillars of a new Web based on NFT economics. Leapfrogging the fragility of links, we can permanently record these more meaningful associations on the blockchain. Instead of a business based on traffic funnels and user-data harvesting, we can have transparent financial flows. The practice and culture of sharing ownership and credit can change the incentives of creation. Through an architecture of composable ideas, we can add to and amplify each other’s efforts that build a tower of innovative work, solidly established on the recognition and reward of its foundations. \\n\\n\\n[Attributions](split://0x38f60E0C7599Ac3088fBEea7552e3064E3C34D40?network=mainnet)\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\",\"timestamp\":1620920801,\"title\":\"The Next Social Graph: Splits, Supports and Attributions\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI\",\"body\":\"a [glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) x [tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) x [darkstar](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) jam\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/999034c9-4b69-4ab7-ab2e-b8cc11fe7cb2.png?height=377\\u0026width=610)\\n\\nAt the edge of the steppes was a bend in the great river. On one side lived herdsmen, on the other were forest people. The nomads valued the forest-dwellers axes and baskets. The forest-dwellers loved the herder’s hides and wool. As the two sides became more familiar with each other, they began to trade. \\n\\nWithin a few years, there was a temporary camp in that bend of the river. It was a perfect place to meet. The two sides would do business, swap stories and eat together. Soon traders were coming throughout the year. The camp became permanent and then became a town. People lived there all the time, a new community formed of people from both sides, catering to the growing number of visitors bringing goods to sell. \\n\\nThanks to its unique location for efficient trade, the town grew quickly and became rich. The richest people built houses, but they also did something else: they built public places. They used their new wealth to make their town even more attractive. They built temples, theaters, schools and libraries, and they funded the priests, playwrights, teachers and scholars who filled them with culture. \\n\\nThis, more or less, is the founding pattern of most of our great cities, the origin story of much of our civilization. A location uniquely conducive to trade becomes a permanent settlement. As the trade grows, the wealth of the community does also, and this wealth is used to fund spaces and content to glorify the town, enlighten and entertain its citizens and attract more visitors.\\n\\nWhen we think about the creation of culture on the blockchain, it is tempting for media people to imagine it freestanding. As if culture were raught whole cloth. [We have written about Creator DAOs](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao) almost as startups emerging from only the imagination of their founders. That’s certainly possible, and those projects will succeed when the products they create are immensely popular. But there’s a more likely path for the first of these projects, mirroring the growth of culture in those first cities. That is to say, culture and creation via patronage and communal backing.\\n\\nOn the crypto map, the most successful protocols are like that bend in the river, the perfect point for value to flow in both directions. A locus for value creation and trade. And when the protocols granted ownership, they went from being purely transactional to communal. They became settlements. (Ali Yahya, Devon Zuegel, Denis Nazarov and Jesse Walden [riffed on that exact analogy in this wonderful A16Z-hosted discussion](https://a16z.com/2018/07/26/cryptonetworks-cities-analogies/).) The inevitable next step is the development of culture around those settlements, and given the soaring value of protocol treasuries, these communities have the financial means to support it.\\n\\nWhat does that look like? \\n\\nCrypto is a ‘nation’ in which communities are now sprouting with their own distinct cultures. The simplest examples are the meme-art that has erupted around tokens. Bitcoin’s laser eyes. Beeple’s Into the Ether. All supported by the flow of funding from passionate investor-fans into NFTs. Another example are the simple websites that have emerged to help newcomers understand and take advantage of the protocol. [Here’s the Zed Gazette](https://zedgazette.com/top-articles/), self-appointed newspaper for the horse-racing game Zed Run, supported by [merch](https://zedstore.run). Another is [The First Mint](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thefirstmint), a fan-created media brand for the popular NBA Top Shot. But Uniswap is leading the next-generation of this idea. The protocol is enabling [artists](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1390042383065178114) to design on-chain SVG generators that will create unique NFTs to represent LP positions on the protocol. \\n\\nBut these examples are just the beginning. As a protocol evolves, there is a sense of responsibility from participating token holders to maintain and evolve the ecosystem being built around it. Like early civilization, there is both a proactive and reactive investment to foster the “city” in order to strengthen its infrastructure, accessibility and desirability. As token holders are owners of the protocol and are incentivized to have it succeed, the role of tokens moves from transactional (i sell for profit) to wealth (i hold for proprietary rights). And this mechanism drives development that welcomes more residents as well as tourists to visit and partake in the civilization’s developments and culture. If the meme is the message, then a protocols’ greatest moat and differentiator may very well end up being the culture it spawned around it.\\n\\nAnd the funding and interest exists for vastly more ambitious creative projects than the crypto equivalent of training materials, corporate PR and investor relations websites. Look at the scale of these community’s resources: https://open-orgs.info. This is communal wealth built at a scale and speed never before seen.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8051d2dc-9704-4341-948c-e96d7ae3f87d.png?height=556\\u0026width=1008)\\n\\nSo what sort of creations could be funded by the protocols and built out by Creator DAOs? \\n\\n- The most obvious is ‘identity art’ for the protocol community to enjoy and share. An Artist DAO could create a whole world of NFTs, tens of thousands of unique items to be dropped to token-holders, perhaps depending on their bag size, history and contributions to the community. As we move into the Metaverse, these NFT could evolve into protocol-branded wearables or vehicles, the meta-equivalent of t-shirts and bumper stickers. (Hey, not all culture is high brow.) \\n\\n- Another valuable project would be definitive reference material on blockchain projects, a so-called ‘Encyclopedia Cryptologica.’ There’s barely any quality, carefully reviewed information on most projects, tokens, concepts -- and where there is, it’s not easily searchable. Only a DAO (or its Wikipedia-like precursor) could mobilize and compensate the huge number of experts and researchers necessary to maintain a living encyclopedia for our exponentially expanding gowing crypto world. \\n\\n- Of course such a project suggests that financial media and ‘literacy’ programs may in general be worthwhile cultural institutions. Imagine a 24/7 CNBC of crypto -- interviews with leading developers and investors, regulators and politicians -- but entirely run by a Creator DAO. Imagine crypto-literacy programs to help potential investors understand the risks of leverage, understand liquidity, volatility, etc.\\n\\n- On the other side of the crypto equation, computer science and crypto-business courses would be valuable educational content products. Investing in these projects may be analogous to community-like events which encourage you to support and contribute to the community.\\n\\n- But there could also be other media types produced, like movies. Crypto is about enabling decentralization to promote creativity and prohibit censorship. So how about a film series about how marginalized creators and communities are using the blockchain to enable and express themselves? Or about artists and inventors who fought centralized control in the past? How about a whole film festival?\\n\\n- New prosperous communities often invent and patronize their own musical culture, a sound and style that stands for their unique perspective on the world. 18th Century European bourgeoisie loved the opera. Baby boomers had rock and roll. Just in time, we have DAO systems like Songcamp, where artists can collaborate and share in the results. Is this the melody of the blockchain? Click and be amazed: (https://twitter.com/songcampdotband/status/1389285939277701122?s=20)\\n\\n- It’s also not hard to imagine funding for debate societies, legal and political conferences and lobbying efforts, even full-fledged science and technology journals. We may even see funding for IRL social events, like Happy Hours, or their digital equivalents. \\n\\nOf course, different protocols have different missions and their communities will support their own distinct cultural products. A blockchain devoted to lower electricity consumption for climate purposes will foster creativity around ecological issues. And, indeed, you can see that happening within the NFT community of Hicetnunc, minted on a chain those artists consider better for the planet.\\n\\nWhat’s really interesting about the relationship between economics and culture is how the culture flows back into the economy. Crossroads towns that built out shrines and cathedrals for their often flimsily-historical patron saints attracted more traffic to their markets. These structures attract tourism and talent that plant their roots and build upon the foundation of what already exists. And the seriousness of the devotion for that culture drove a sense of civic duty that caused citizens to invest in and defend their cities. \\n\\nWe cannot underestimate the enormous emotional power that creative products instill in the communities that invest in and embrace them. It often takes time for the full significance of these products to emerge. Their potential impact is rarely obvious. The paths they take can be strange. Consider the song that has become the anthem of New York City, played at sporting events, parades and, most strikingly, during the darkest hours of the Covid epidemic. *“New York New York”* was written as a title tune to a forgettable 1977 Robert DeNiro-Liza Minelli movie, then picked up by Sinatra. Somehow, the words perfectly represent the city. *Bomp, bomp, bah-de-dah.*.How many people have been subtly inspired to visit or move to New York because of it? How many people found hope in it this past year? The song has become so ingrained in the city’s DNA that is no longer the song from the movie or the song from Sinatra. It’s New York’s song. \\n\\nWe may be seeing the beginnings of this kind of culture formation in crypto. In fact, it may be even turbocharged, as crypto enables the financialization of social and communal activity in a manner never before seen. This makes clear the need and role for ambitious and thoughtful cultural governance now that creative structures, businesses and behaviors are being built on top of the protocol’s foundation. As proverbial neighborhoods sprout up, subcultures will be built in reaction to the constructs and its visitors and identity will evolve. In doing so, this activity will begin to invite criticism of how or what is built, by those most deeply invested in the protocol and the community it’s fostered. There will be disagreements. There will be overly kitsch and propagandistic creation. But in the end, the protocols that can produce the most meaningful and lasting communities, in large part through content and cultural creation, will be the most lasting, wealthiest and important. In crypto, soft power is everything. \\n\\n[The proceeds of this NFT will go towards protocol treasuries mentioned and the co-authors of this post.](split://0x27E3Fdccc6e4f422f4Cc0961294e907F5f31284B?network=mainnet)\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI\",\"timestamp\":1620319572,\"title\":\"Protocols and Creator DAOs: Economic Flows and Cultural Products\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao\",\"body\":\"*a [Tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) x [Dicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) collab*\\n\\n*Web2 communities were built on intrinsic incentives.

We called this theoretical format a ‘Creator DAO.’ In this paradigm, a team or community interested in making something would implement a smart contract according to which tokens in the project would be granted to contributors, customers or investors, in return for their labor or money. \\n\\nFor example, a group of people who wanted to design a line of shoes might sell tokens in their project to people who believed in their vision. These tokens would bestow several privileges on their holders. They might provide token-holders with discounted pricing and/or priority access to the project’s product. They could give token-holders the ability to vote on shoe designs or other project decisions. They might even provide token-holders with a share of profits when such exist. And of course, the tokens could be sold to other people for profit, if as a result of the success of the project the value of the token increased. In addition to cash, tokens might be earned through work on the project. Designers, marketers, manufacturing and financial experts could be awarded tokens in return for their involvement in the shoe project. Even smaller contributions, like helping a social campaign go viral or providing survey feedback on packaging, could result in token grants. \\n\\nSo how is this different from crowdfunding like Kickstarter or membership platforms like Patreon? These three frameworks have plenty in common, most importantly, the goal of making it possible for more people to make stuff. But the main difference that a Creator DAO provides is the notion of ownership. You are not simply *supporting* a project. Through the token, you *possess* a piece of it. And, within the rules of its smart contract, are free to use the token as you want. You can sell it, stake it, fractionalize it, include it in an index, take advantage of all of the liquidity-enhancing mechanisms DeFi enables. In other words, with a CreatorDAO, in addition to wanting to help people make stuff because you like the stuff they’ll make, you get financial incentives. You are an investor. A true owner.\\n\\nSo then how is it different from traditional investing? Again, there’s plenty of similarities here too. Investors own parts of businesses, and depending on the terms and size of their ownership, can vote on issues affecting the company, receive dividends, and at some point, sell their share. The difference is the more fluid and flexible nature of a token. Most companies don’t sell shares to the public until fairly late in their evolution given the transaction, regulatory and coordination costs associated with going public. Meanwhile, private company shares are difficult to sell, generally locked up, either by contract or practical reality, for years. Tokens are typically issued early if not at the beginning of a project. They can and do sell whenever the owner desires. And the potential use-cases are as broad as the creators can imagine. It’s slow and expensive, for instance, to reward a small contribution to a traditional company with an equity grant. But tokens make it easy and inexpensive. You’d never have a special shoe design available only to private equity investors. There wouldn’t be enough of them for that to be worthwhile. With tokens, it makes perfect sense.\\n\\nPut another way, in order to engage as many people as possible as deeply as possible, Creator DAOs intertwine two kinds of motivations that are usually seen as far apart: social and financial. A ‘traditional’ content website, for example, would never consider its investors and community members in the same way, or try to provide them with a single currency as reward for their distinct kinds of participation. Which isn’t to say that pre-DAO creators didn’t recognize the need to reward their users. They definitely (and increasingly) did. They just envisioned it as an entirely different system of incentives, running parallel to but disconnected from those of its investors. Or perhaps more accurately, subordinate to the company’s financial system. If you think about it, a major feature of the most successful Web 2.0 products was precisely this: the creation of currencies that were valued but weren’t directly financial. Remember ‘gamification?’ Likes, follows, friends and badges -- all so central to the social web we barely notice anymore that all of these were inventions designed to incentivize free labor. In many ways, this has been the core focus of the last few decades of consumer Internet.\\n\\n**Web2: Tapping Intrinsic Incentives**\\n\\nWhen The Huffington Post looked to grow participation on their [platform in 2010](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/introducing-huffpost-badg_b_557168), they introduced the behavior of **badging**. Seemingly simple, badging was responsible for the growth of The Huffington Post over any other participatory tool or tactic because the intrinsic benefits tied to the community’s status and identity encouraged engagement on platform and off. The more a community member participated in set tasks, the more benefits they unlocked. \\n\\nThis entire process started in the comments section. To encourage healthy discourse and increased engagement, users were tasked to moderate and direct conversations. This action was rewarded with a **moderator badge**. This moderator badge gave individuals permission to fully moderate discourse across all articles and be featured as commenters. There were other badges as well they gave additional benefits. For example, [the **pundits badge**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/huffpost-pundits-badge_b_691473) gave individual’s the ability to have their comments highlighted in multiple arenas, as well as the ability to leave longer comments. This made the community conversations starters. It was an engine to The Huffington Post’s growth. It benefitted The Huffington Post by keeping good conversation and discourse on their platform, thus growing their page views, revenue and market share. \\n\\nThis was done only by tapping intrinsic incentives, by enabling users to ‘earn’ within a status economy that existed only inside the website. Individuals wanted to better their reputation as a commenter or contributor and the platform enabled that. For a while, it worked incredibly well. But there was an obvious and inherent contradiction. If the Huffington Post was getting more *financially* valuable, and a major reason for that increase were the massive contributions of its motivated community, why were the members paid only in badges and not in money? When HuffPo sold to AOL, the investors got rich, the community got nothing.\\n\\n**Web3: Adding Extrinsic Incentives**\\n\\nA HuffPo based on fungible tokens, instead of badges, could have had a different outcome. The earliest and most active contributors could have been paid when the company was purchased. In fact, they could have been selling their $HUFF tokens for other valuable assets all along. Those who held on to them or bought more might even have blocked the sale. More likely, it would have evolved into an entirely different product.\\n\\nSo maybe the more interesting way to think about Creator DAOs is not in how they would change the products and companies we already know and rather what totally new creations they might make possible. By broadening the motivations for someone to assist early-stage and/or independent creators, Creator DAOs open up new opportunities outside of existing businesses and infrastructures. \\n\\nConsider local news, a market which is essential to the functioning of our real-world communities but which has become almost impossible for entrepreneurs and investors. One effort taking a different approach to this mission is *The Devil Strip* in Akron, Ohio. Faced with a need for capital as well as a commitment to deeply engage its readership, this arts and culture magazine is being structured as a co-op. Readers and workers own *The Devil Strip*:\\n\\n“[That means we are locally owned in the truest sense: Readers can become shareholders in *The Devil Strip*](https://thedevilstrip.com/co-op/). Being a shareholder means your voice will shape the future of our publication, as long as you have an Ohio address. (We cannot yet offer shares out of state for legal reasons, but we welcome donations from our friends everywhere!).\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/68530646-5b52-41c5-9f87-23328aeea39a.png?height=233\\u0026width=646)\\n\\nEven though it’s not often employed in media, at least not yet, the co-op structure is well-established and widely-used in all sorts of contexts. *The Devil Strip* can lean on generations of practical lessons and law from the co-op world. There’s every indication that it’ll work. But might this project work better as a Creator DAO?\\n\\nThere are two big advantages to Creator DAOs and tokens: liquidity and functionality. Not unlike crowdfunding, a co-op share has no financial incentive. You can’t sell it or use it to make money. That’s not necessarily a problem. It may even be a feature. There may be enough people in Akron who want the magazine so much that they are willing to fund it strictly based on that desire. Or based on the social benefits of being recognized as supportive members. And the lack of a profit motive may incentivize the collective to focus more on public benefit. But it’s possible there would be significantly more potential funders of the *The Devil Strip*, making better long term decisions, if those intrinsic motivations were intertwined with extrinsic ones. \\n\\nThe main question to ask is: Do we want shareholder’s to profit from their investment? It’s not a simple question. What makes a Creator DAO significantly different than, say, a media co-op is that the options for the latter are limited when it comes to whether and how they make money from their investment. Tokens enable fractionalization and staking, all utilities for individuals to either leverage or liquidate their ownership asset. This makes a token share of something worth more than a co-op share, even if they have the same governance and utility benefits. Tokens also enable indexing. We can imagine an index fund or on-chain investment club that invests in Creator DAOs all over the country, providing more reliable funding for projects like *The Devil Strip*. In short, token holders are incentivized financially to increase the value of their holdings and to scale such holdings. As such, one way to think about a Creator DAO is as a profit-motivated community, combining the profit and social incentives in one. \\n\\nMuch of our social and financial structures have been designed to incentivize contribution and reward participation and coordination. Incentive mechanisms have always been critical to build a healthy, highly participatory community of any kind. But historically, these systems and incentive mechanisms have been fractured and separate across spheres. We’ve had political systems for organizing participation in mass movements. We’ve had corporations and other financial structures for organizing participation in business endeavors. And we’ve had status systems for organizing participation in social activities. DAO’s potentially combine all of these structures at once. The mission of DAOs is to have everyone who can be helpful be a part of the collective, and therefore to have a suitable reward for every potential contributor. To do so, they combine financial incentives with social status and political representation. DAOs in effect, provide a brand new OS for participation. \\n\\nAnd like an OS, they enable creations that could never have been anticipated. So when thinking about Creator DAOs forget about the structures that currently exist today. Beginner’s mindset is a critical attribute to how we evolve our thinking and our products, and presenting a new paradigm to how things could be architected will not just evolve our current models but create entirely new ones for us to leverage and explore. Yes, we can port over the ‘rules and roles’ from journalism or shoe design and theorize how they can work within a DAO framework. But that limits the opportunity that the DAO introduces. It’s not about creating old stuff with a DAO.’ It’s about ‘the new stuff a DAO allows us to create.\\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao\",\"timestamp\":1619629732,\"title\":\"Creator DAOs: An OS for Participation \",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM\",\"body\":\"An alternative history of platforms, publishing, politics, and power.\\n\\n*a [Jonathan Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick), [Tal Shachar](https://twitter.com/tweettal) \\u0026 Jarrod Dicker joint.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/48d7ce19-4d7e-4cac-a0eb-fa1fb782fb32.png?height=746\\u0026width=486)\\n\\nThere’s an alternative story of Substack. Imagine the following:\\n\\nOnce upon a time, not so long ago, some entrepreneurs started a company that offered writers an easy way to distribute and charge for their newsletters. Their business model would be elegant-- the writer would get the software for free, and only pay a percentage of their subscription revenues (10%) to the platform if the writer decided to charge at all. \\n\\nMost importantly, the entrepreneurs emphasized this new platform would empower writers. It would not be a new social aggregator standing in the way between author and audience. The platform would not own the subscribers. The writer would. And she could take them with her if she decided to leave. \\n\\nThis offer was generally appealing. The design was good. It was easy to use. They attracted a number of writers around various topics and communities. A number of these writer’s soon attracted a decent number of loyal subscribers. But revenues remained pretty small despite momentum and the costs of development and operations were not insignificant. The platform needed capital to grow.\\n\\nBut here’s where the stream of time split from our reality. (Cue spooky sci-fi sound effects.) Because in *this* other dimension, the platform entrepreneurs didn’t raise venture money. Maybe this was because they couldn’t. Maybe VCs didn’t want to invest in yet another media tech play. Or maybe it was because the entrepreneurs didn’t want to. \\n\\nInstead, they decided to raise capital by selling crypto tokens directly to the Substack subscriber community. To make them worth buying, all subscriptions and payments were moved on-chain so that the tokens could provide their owners a number of utility benefits. First, they could be used as a way of pre-paying for newsletters in advance (support). Second, they might be associated with some profit-sharing once the platform started earning money. And lastly, the tokens would be used for governance purposes, for votes on the future strategy of the platform project itself. In essence, the platform, Substack, had become a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.\\n\\nOur other-dimension Substack team granted themselves some amount of the tokens, and perhaps under pressure, they granted some to their writers based on some formula of subscribers and/or revenues. Then, the big moment, they let Substack subscribers know they were available for purchase.  \\n\\nThe token sale was a success! Loyal participants, encouraged by their favorite newsletter-authors, jumped at the chance to get more deeply involved in Substack. Some of the top writers even bought more tokens themselves, using their earnings to increase their position. The price of the token quickly went up, and even people who had not yet known about the project piled in. \\n\\n**Substack, the Lender**\\n\\nAs the platform began to scale, much like in our own timeline, the project faced a big challenge. A lot of the platform’s most desirable writers, writers who could almost certainly attract a ton of paying subscribers, were currently paid employees of media companies. For them to leave those jobs and come to a platform where they were paid by subscribers meant taking a risk, and for some amount of time at least, perhaps a severe pay cut. \\n\\nThen, one day in the Substack discord, somebody had an idea; What if the project used the funds they just had raised to not only pay for tech and ops, but to offer some very popular writers a guarantee for the first year? It would be a bit of a gamble. These mainstream media writers’ might not be successful on the platform. But the proposal’s proponents argued that the project had no choice but to try it. The alternative would be to just wait for the slower growth of independent less well-known writers.\\n\\nIt was the community’s first big vote -- and it passed by a large majority. A long list of columnists and journalists had been approved for invitation to the guarantee program. To nobody’s surprise, most of these ignored or declined the offer. But some of the invited writers agreed. Still others requested a larger sum, forcing Substack to work out a kind of negotiation model where token-holders approved this new amount. Within a few months, some very big names were writing on the platform.\\n\\nTo the surprise of even the staunchest guarantee program advocates, the results were amazing. Many of the invited authors gained more subscribers than anticipated, easily outperforming expectations. In fact, most of the most popular writers on the platform were now guarantee recipients. \\n\\nThere was only one issue; as was the case in our reality, when the Substack community looked at exactly which of the guarantee writers were performing best, it turned out there was a pattern. A meaningful percentage of their top performers, whether from the left-wing or right, were those self-described as ‘anti-woke.’ As the business model is to subscribe to an individual, the relationship became less just about the content the person created and more about the position the person took. A new business of Opinions. \\n\\nIn retrospect, this should have been at least somewhat obvious. Who was more likely to take the leap from a ‘mainstream’ publication? Someone who was critical of what he, she, or they considered a ‘stultifying newsroom orthodoxy.’ Who might attract plenty of paying subscribers? Someone who provided news and views for the engaged audience who hated those allegedly repressive newsrooms. \\n\\nThe implications of this were challenging to say the least. Even though Substack did not promote their guaranteed or most popular newsletters, it seemed inevitable that these writers would come to represent the project overall. What if the association made it harder to attract readers and writers of other perspectives? What if alternative newsletter platforms seized the opportunity to steal away writers and this competition caused the token’s value began to fall? What if supporting these writers was simply wrong.\\n\\nSoon enough, Substack’s owner-community began raising the issue. They organized into three factions. There was the group of people who felt that the current program was working fine. They should continue to offer guarantees to well-known writers and whoever was successful. The second group argued that the guarantee program, for all of its success, had at the very least become too damaging to the brand of the project, and should be discontinued. If these ‘anti-woke’ writers continue to use the platform, fine, but any perception of editorial endorsement should be eliminated. The final group thought Substack should recognize that the biggest opportunity was to help develop writers that would reach underrepresented communities. By making a special effort to reach out to and even subsidize promising contributors before they were famous, they could expand the brand and the platform. These folks also felt that especially toxic writers should be banned from using the Substack platform.\\n\\nThe debate raged. There was much discordance. The project team, the readers, even those who only owned the token as an investment, all weighed in. The writers were loudest of all, rallying their followers across social media. You can probably guess which of Substack’s naturally (and professionally) argumentative pundits fell into which camp. And in some cases you’d be right. But interestingly, the debate became more complicated than that. Many of the most popular ‘anti-wokeists’ now had a lot of potential wealth tied up in Substack tokens. Some of them recognized that having the brand over-associated with one political stance, and especially with really notorious trolls, was potentially a huge drag on their value. Several of these writers came out in favor of expanding subsidies to female, POC, LGBTQ, and other underrepresented writers. Meanwhile, some of those opposed to the ‘anti-wokeists,’ despite the momentum of their position, decided to leave anyway, starting their own competitive DAO. \\n\\n**The Difference Between Substack and DAOstack**\\n\\nSo how did these two timelines differ? In many ways, they didn’t. The platform’s features were pretty much the same. The people who were popular here were popular there. The dynamic which seems to especially infect our opinion pages was just as salient in the other dimension.\\n\\nBut there were some subtle differences. The positions of the writers, who really are at the heart of the current debate, were not simply tweets or quotes in a Ben Smith column, not just the views of disgruntled or delighted customers. In the alternative Substack world, they were the opinions of owners seeking to influence other owners. Everyone involved recognized that the value of their tokens was directly connected to the decisions the community would make, and the high value that would result from finding a solution that would be most appealing to readers and writers.\\n\\nAnd in the case where the community found that solution, the DAOstack perhaps built a thriving ecosystem. As co-owners, readers actively recommended newsletters to their family and friends. The token soared in value, and the treasury became the largest single source of funding for independent journalism and opinion. Excess funds were invested in other tokens for growth and diversification, a kind of endowment. Standing committees were created to select writers who would cover underfunded subjects and communities, which introduced other possible models for book publishing and local journalism.  If a writer was not offered a grant by one of the standing committees, any token-holder or group of holders could still independently decide to provide funding. Over time, these independently originated guarantees became the majority of loans to new writers. \\n\\nBut what if our two timelines collided? What if, as happens from time to time in multiverses, these two dimensions became one, and Substack Inc and DAOstack both existed in the same place and time? [Alien vs. Predator?Adam Warlock vs. Magus?](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Magus_(Earth-7528)) Who would win and why?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e2cbd81-d616-44a6-b23a-0c5e81a95236.png?height=936\\u0026width=614)\\n\\n**The Final Battle.**\\n\\nOne way to think about this is to compare how successful the two institutions would be as lenders. To oversimplify, lenders compete on three aspects: who can source the most and most promising borrowers; who can price a loan most accurately -- ie., determine how much capital and at what rate to give to ensure the most lucrative return; and who can acquire capital most inexpensively. In other words, you want to amass money at the lowest price, and give the right amount at the right price to the most people. \\n\\nThere’s no reason Substack Inc. couldn’t become an excellent scale lender for all sorts of paid media projects. But DAOStack might have some unique competitive advantages. \\n\\nFor writers and other creators, a project owned by writers and readers is a potentially appealing partner. Like Vanguard in mutual funds or non-profits who run hospitals, there’s real brand benefit that comes from being perceived as a natural ally. Maybe you’re slightly more likely to believe they are ‘on your side.’ And, socially, the fact some of your existing readers and fellow writers are likely to be DAOstack owners, makes it more likely that you’ll hear about the offer in positive terms. After all, they have a vested interest in promoting it to you.\\n\\nDetermining who represents a good investment and how much to stake them is a trickier, more technical capability. Presumably, over time, both Substack Inc. and DAOStack would employ algorithms that analyzed the writer’s follower base, their writing history, and the appeal of their topical focus. Maybe one would be better at this. Maybe they’d be evenly matched. In any case, it’s likely that both would continue to use human judgment, overriding the ‘computer’ when a writer felt like a good risk, or an important one, anyway. Which would be better at this? Substack Inc. would not suffer from the raucous arguments of the token-holder committees, and could perhaps allocate capital more efficiently. DAOStack’s independent token-holders and market model might be more successful in identifying smaller unexpected winners. \\n\\nPerhaps the DAO’s biggest advantage would be the amount of capital it could quickly accumulate.  When combined with an enthusiastic community of investors, the frictionless nature of DeFi enables capital formation at hyperspeed. It is hard to imagine that a centralized venture-backed company could match these abilities. \\n\\nHere in our dimension, we are in the midst of a wave of venture investing in the creator economy. Companies building new platforms for writers, artists, and other makers are closing huge rounds from A-list investors. These investments are driving much-needed product innovation. Even more importantly, they are increasingly providing the financial subsidies necessary to transition people from employment to independence. But these platforms depend on brilliant creators, and they depend on the users who are loyal to them. Without their buy-in, none of it works, at least, not for long. It’s quite possible that the decentralized ownership model enabled by DAOs and DeFi can perform as well or better as the venture one, while providing those stakeholders with a seat at the decision-making table and a piece of the pie. Why not an OnlyFans owned by the performers? Why not a Clubhouse governed by the influencers?\\n\\nDecentralization doesn’t eliminate the hard problems. It doesn’t wish away wars over values; hierarchies of professional vs amateur; the challenges of developing and nurturing talent. And, token-based governance isn’t necessarily going to reach the best or most ethical solutions. But the participatory purpose of a DAO makes the debates around these issues transparent. They make them a matter for the community. Instead of having ‘management’ struggle to accommodate different constituencies, the costs/benefits tradeoffs are born by the community directly and managed by the community itself. DeFi, by reducing the transaction costs and creating the infrastructure needed to operate such a system finally enables true community-run organizations.\\n\\nOur colliding Substacks both bring value to their communities. Both can serve as an evolution to transition into a world when you can have both financial support, creator capital, and a collective-based media platform. As we move from a purely brand-led to a talent-led media ecosystem, the venture model should evolve to encourage both the talent and its community to be owners and drivers of the experience. \\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM\",\"timestamp\":1618935259,\"title\":\"Substack vs. DAOstack\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs\",\"body\":\"![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590286162167-70fb467846ae?ixid=mxwxmja3fdb8mhxwag90by1wywdlfhx8fgvufdb8fhw%3d\\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1\\u0026auto=format\\u0026fit=crop\\u0026w=1350\\u0026q=80)\\n\\n\\n\\n*In 2018, [I wrote an article for Token Daily](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/reputation-in-web-3) on the web's reputation systems. Three years later, we've hit many of the milestones. Below is an update to the original version that includes some recent advancements.*\\n\\nReputation, on the Internet, has been warped. We’ve built an information system that rewards recency and relevancy mechanics, with an aim more towards discoverability than integrity. It has become a competition to generate results for result’s sake. We’ve strayed away from the efforts that make something truly reputable and instead over-indexed on the end result, generalizing how we value information on the web today. It doesn’t matter what you put into it as long as what comes out matches the criteria for success. And that’s wrong.\\n\\nThere’s a very simple reason for this behavior: we don’t know what the systems to derive reputation look like on a global scale. It’s not quantifiable, and at a baseline isn’t a definition that is mutually agreed upon by all. Filtering this much content on the web, even in groups powered by large computing systems, is too influenced by outside sociological and political pressures. This filtering pushes towards filter bubbles and separates in an effort to integrate. Not to mention, outside incentives are hindering our ability to deliver anything of absolute true value.\\n\\nTo create stronger reputation signals in this newest iteration of the web, we’re going to need to build off of the benefits of the previous versions of the web and leverage the coordination abilities that come from an uncensorable, highly available, and ubiquitous database. We need to align technology with the ethics and value we as a society hold dear. This, of course, leads us to a blockchain powered by an incentive system that rewards participation and holds accountability through immutability.\\n\\n*So let’s start from the beginning.*\\n\\n**Democratized**\\n\\nIn the first attempt to build out the web, we didn’t have a set way to determine and identify what was reputable or established. The web itself was in its infancy and wasn’t structured to maintain the responsibility it eventually held as becoming the technical system for society. What we found out very quickly was that this system enabled all humans to express themselves freely and openly in a way that not only made them unique, but made them connected to the rest of the world. The web became a society of information.\\n\\nDirectories were the first way to sort all of this information through some reasonably well-defined hierarchy. We started grouping websites together as “web rings” to trade traffic with one another; once you identified a good site, you could expect similar quality from the other participants within the ring. Search engines built giant computing engines in order to index all of the information, created the first filtering algorithms, and made it easy to actively find things we expressed intent on learning about based on how many times the content was referenced on other websites.\\n\\nParticipating in the first web was open and democratized, but there was some significant issues. Filtering all of that information in a way to help quality content surface to the top was extremely problematic. Search engine optimization (SEO) became a game that had extremely high rewards for those who could land themselves in the top results for high volume keywords. To become good at finding the results that mattered to you, you had to learn boolean algebra. Collecting and crawling all of the websites as the primary way to capture information can leave some content behind. If the author wasn’t well-versed at the black magic that is SEO, there’s a chance that their content might not be indexed correctly which could create an artificial censorship. Of course, some of the companies that built search engines aren’t even allowed to serve results in certain countries which has created a very real censorship issue. Searching is a very active process and doesn’t help us passively find content that might be relevant to our needs. Directories did a good job at categorizing content to ”surf through”, but that still took hours of work sometimes to find what you were looking for if you weren’t exactly sure on how to describe it.\\n\\n**Web 1.0** didn’t create a strong way to expose reputable content, but it completely democratized content creation, distribution, and monetization. For a first attempt, we made something that forever impacted how every human in the world receives information. The next leap was distribution.\\n\\n**Distributed**\\n\\n**Web 2.0** was all about your content living where the users were. We developed these new platforms with engagements such as likes, retweets, and upvotes as the next way to build reputation signals for content. Each action created a public signal that could be used to help personalize content that could now be delivered to users on the platforms passively because we knew what was popular within each other’s social groups without requiring intent to give meaningful results.\\n\\nPlatforms from Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter accelerated the standardization of making an Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) available which created a more distributed way to access content instead of relying on search and created massive ecosystems of developers expanding their reach. However, your content would no longer just live on your website or blog, but it now had to be modified to fit the platforms in which it was hosted on. As of July 2018, there are at least 20 social platforms with more than 200 million users. For someone tasked with delivering information, it was critical understand how information moved and how best to deliver it across technical borders. Each platform had a separate algorithm and list of “success” criteria, creating far more complexity than SEO.\\n\\nThe goal was to strike up relevant conversations and share interesting topics with each other, but instead we all became acutely aware of how our actions represented our reputation, honesty and accountability. Although we had more ways to access content than we ever had with completely centralized platforms, we concentrated effort towards a handful of platforms that had mastered distribution which [something] power again to a small handful of platforms. The products weren’t just the platforms anymore; the products had become the publishers and the source for reputation on the web. Naturally, most users started manipulating the algorithms to paint the picture they wanted seen, not what was really happening or was important. We started valuing our efforts by quantifying it in the likes, retweets and comments our content captured and again gaming the underlying systems that powered reputation.\\n\\nWeb 2.0 gave us a whole new lens to start looking at content through and our relationships between each other became an integral part of how we consumed information. No longer did we have to seek out information, but instead we created an issue where we had too much coming at us at all times. We trusted our friends, but not the sources our friends used, which created a significant difficulty in determining the reputation of content. Social signals didn’t tell the whole truth about the reputation of content, but did again provided a profound new way to connect all of the people on earth.\\n\\n**Decentralized**\\n\\nMisinformation is more present and accessible than ever, and “truth” and “trust” are no longer objective in the eyes of all consumers. This is where we need to play in what I call “the gray”. How can we build a system that is impartial, not necessarily pushing people towards a black or white but rather exposing information in the gray? To do that, we need a decentralized record of information and an incentive system to build towards a common goal for the network, by the network. The next wave of the web is truly about reputation, and not only what is recent and relevant.\\n\\nThe next web of reputation systems is starting to develop and all signs point to blockchain technologies being the foundation. We are now able to deliver information that’s easily curated but uncensorable. We’re working with data sets and information that is ubiquitous but not overwhelming. The bridge to this web is connecting content with accountability through immutability and reputation. This participation and ownership will push towards a new culture, and not succumb to the vanity that unearthed in the distribution phase. We’re making the web free again.\\n\\nTogether, we’re building the foundation for a verifiable web, a place where we can construct the next generation of technologies that highlight the value of the individual. This is what makes reputation in this era different; it’s about the individual, the efforts that go into a given action and integrating systems to measure that. It’s not about the platforms where information is distributed or the channels where it is found, it is about the individual sender and the value tied to their efforts.\\n\\nBecause of this, the next chapter of reputation will flip from “reputation of platform and publisher” to “reputation of individual.” The source of reputation is no longer with the platform where the creator resides but tethered to the creator itself. Consumers, observers and owners are becoming more creator specific; there is less trust in the platforms and distribution mechanisms and more on the messengers that deliver. Through decentralization, we’re able to build systems that enable these messengers to separate dependency from platforms for audience, revenue and growth. It opens a new economy where reputation is aligned directly with the creator.\\n\\nCurrently, there have been platforms that enable coordination and allocation of intrinsic or extrinsic “capital” to achieve shared goal. With blockchain-based networks, we want to incentivize participants towards some predictable outcome that is beneficial for every network participant. It’s not just about the group, but also about the network participant themself.\\n\\nWhat’s most exciting about this next era of permissionless innovation is that it’s not longer dependent on a central authority. It’s not dependent on host, network, publisher or platform. This era of reputation is not built and dictated by a set standard of link share clubs or opaque algorithms. It’s adjustable, adaptable, managed and maintained by your preferences. We no longer need to be strictly driven by how a single platform categorizes, aggregates, and rewards. We can rely on each other to index this information now in a way that benefits all of the participants.\\n\\nIt is important that we understand the values of this new era of permissionless systems as they pertain to the individual. The biggest value that this brings, and what separates it from prior mechanics in democratized and distributed systems is the opportunity of interoperability. This new era means that all the work someone puts within a single network can now be collected and used beyond that network. Interoperable reputation in the decentralized era is the freedom to leverage what you’ve built beyond restrictive borders. As an example, let’s look at the media landscape:\\n\\nIn media, the main driver for revenue is both subscriptions and advertising. These two means fund the growth of media on the web and are platform specific. That means, when someone subscribes or advertises to something, they do so on the platform rather than the individual. The platform holds the reputation, and the individual leverages the platform to build their own audience and value. An example is the writer relationship to the Washington Post, the photographer’s relationship to Getty Images or a musicians relationship to Spotify. There are many. These reputation based systems are prominent in democratized and distributed eras but begin to fail in the decentralized phase. This is a good thing. Here’s how it works:\\n\\nThe current: The value and ways of driving revenue for creators through advertising and subscriptions are currently platform specific, even though they are all driven by wanting to own a message directly. The reputation is tied to the platform as dictated by the democratized and distributed web. In this era of reputation (decentralized) this balance shifts.\\n\\nThe shift: The creator’s reputation is now the value. It's no longer about advertising or transacting with the NYT or Spotify or Getty directly. It’s about transacting with that creator wherever that creator is. This is doable now because reputation is aligned with the individual itself.\\n\\nThe result: a monolithic shift in the opportunity for creators and the restraints of the companies that are currently working as hard as possible to best represent them. It’s no longer a forfeiture of reputation to centralized systems, it’s taking ownership and allowance of your own value, your own reputation. In this case, the reputation is now on the individual, not the platform or the grantor; you, and your work are what is reputable and that carries throughout the entire web ecosystem, regardless of the platform it lives on.\\n\\nThis shift towards individuality as a driver of reputation in the decentralized era is exactly what will drive everyone towards a better web. Each stage has shown a both progress and digress in where we aim to go and how far we still have to go to get there. With this next step towards reputation, individuals are now empowered by the commitment to the openness of ecosystem and the network of builders, verifiers and maintainers of a healthy and newfound ecosystem. There will no doubt be short falls, but investing in building networks that account for interoperability, freedom and openness move us closer to a web where we can find better information, better knowledge and better trust. This is the future of a reputable web. The web of the individual.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs\",\"timestamp\":1617472185,\"title\":\"Reputation in Web3\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY\",\"body\":\"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/743d74ad-f82c-494f-be3d-d6aa40409420.jpeg?height=194\\u0026width=450)\\n\\nImagine this… \\n\\nDark Star, a publication, produces articles. Those articles can be purchased as NFTs, at any point in the ideation -\\u003e writing -\\u003e editing -\\u003e published lifecycle. There are two tiers of access to those articles: As a ‘Reader,’ for $10 bucks a month, I get to read all of the published articles. But as an ‘Investor,’ for $20 bucks a month, I get a share in the sale of the NFTs. As an investor, you have transparency as to what is being created and what the benefits are as a token holder of that NFT. \\n\\nCan you see that future?\\n\\nOver the past few years, as subscriptions have made a comeback, media companies have spent about 90% of their resources towards building and maintaining subscription models around content and about 10% experimenting with tools and features that provide benefits to their subscribers.\\n\\nThe majority of thinking for expanding value for subscribers is to expand verticals, coverage and genre. When actually, the subscriber is most interested in the particular voice, often niche, that the publisher provides. Scale is no longer horizontal, it’s vertical, and value is found in the depths of niche vs. the expansion of topics. The opportunity for content expansion is less about hiring, acquiring and monetizing a new topic and more about collaboration with creators and media companies that are already trusted in that topic. But that’s for another essay. \\n\\nInstead of focusing so heavily on content expansion, creators and publishers need to be thinking about building features they can provide their most loyal customers-- the subscriber. The goal should be to have subscribers identify directly with the creator and feel invested in their work. They should feel value in the environment the creator is building outside of the content itself, through community, collaboration and participation. These features and tools should enable that, which makes loyalty and retention as a functioning utility vs. a sentiment. \\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1371535000336793603)\\n\\nThere are a ton of ways to do this, the most popular is tiered membership for subscribers based on how much and how often they pay. Premium subscription tiers aren’t new, in fact, most legacy publications leverage this. But the problem is, 90% of the value is tied to more content. On new platforms like Substack, they take it a step further with subscription tier options tied to the content \\u0026 the creator relationship; pay monthly for content, pay annually for content, pay $XXXX for a mystery tier. Now these mystery tiers or founding tiers as some call them, are often unknown, but the assumption is that creators will provide subscribers with products outside of the content itself that bring value and new benefits. This can include community products on discord, exclusive access to Q\\u0026As, a direct line to the creator... basically, similar to what The Information does today. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9974e800-f35b-4a5c-8012-81c6bfc2d464.jpeg?height=230\\u0026width=537)\\n\\nBut what's amazing with Substack that's under discussed is that subscribers actually do feel like they're investing in creator success. They subscribe for the content but also because they want that creator to continue doing what they do. There's just no financial association with that success.\\n\\n[I wrote an article](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI) a few weeks ago about how media companies could think about evolving to an ownership structure--\\n\\n“This new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside.”\\n\\nMirror, the platform that this article is published on, is implementing this structure for writers today. [John Palmer pioneered this model when he launched his $ESSAY project](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0) last month and on Sunday, [Mario Gabriele and Jack Butcher launched the crowdfund of their project $GENERALIST](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/generalist-token). The details of this model are described and executed in both of their projects, as it relates to the creators, the crowdfund and the community as investors. Taking it a step further, I see this as an evolutionary model to the media's subscription business. \\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1371273870334947328)\\n\\nToday, as seen through John, Mario and Jack’s work, these are project based. The creator crowdfund's for the project, in return they give the community members $tokens. The project, once completed, is minted to an NFT and then all $token holders get a fixed percentage of the total amount the NFT sold for. In the scenario dreamt up above, this moves from project based to publication based. Each month, token holders get allotted more $Darkstar and since each piece of content is minted as an NFT, the returns are everlasting throughout the duration of the publication. \\n\\nThere is a lot that needs to be done in the evolution of NFT’s, creator DAOs and alignment with the media business’ current comfort level. But as we move towards a world that is more creator direct, subscribers should have the opportunity to literally invest in their favorite creators and share upside in their success. As seen above, it’s already happening today, so we’re not too far off from this reality. \\n\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nthx to [Jonathan Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) for his eyes on this piece.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY\",\"timestamp\":1615925571,\"title\":\"A Media Ownership Model: Why Subscribe When You Can Invest?\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\",\"body\":\"\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/22000/1\\\\*WSU7jClH_cq0BWV4GQnVDA.jpeg)\\n\\n[Florian Klauer](https://unsplash.com/@florianklauer?utm_source=unsplash\\\\\\u0026utm_medium=referral\\\\\\u0026utm_content=creditCopyText)\\n\\n[In my last piece](https://medium.com/@jarroddicker/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b), I proposed that the media companies of tomorrow should look like the record labels of today. In the music industry, talent is the driving force behind its business. Talent is the source of the reputation and the end of the line when it comes to driving financial returns. Without world-class talent creating great products, it doesn’t matter how well you promote or polish it — the results will be the same.\\n\\nThe “monetize the individual” disruption in media serves as an opportunity for business reinvention of companies who choose to recognize and react to this newly acknowledged trend forming. It’s not just about enabling and liberating talent, but more importantly about maintaining, supporting and growing that individual’s business better than they’re able to do on their own or elsewhere. The future media business will extend to newfound territory that fortunately for them, is right in its wheelhouse: Talent Management (Artists and Repertoire A\\\\\\u0026R).\\n\\nNow if media companies are record labels then[ journalists are rock stars](https://breakermag.com/po-et-ceo-jarrod-dicker-wants-to-turn-journalists-into-rock-stars/). And while media companies spend time working to restructure and focus their business on talent and become “the label”, we’ll see a lot of individuals exit the major “labels” and go independent. These creators will then structure themselves as independent media companies and develop micro labels themselves.\\n\\nAs these media companies and platforms start to become venues for creator operations and development, the individual’s brand becomes a business of its own. The journey someone takes to build their business is completely uncharted and adapts natively to their specific needs. That’s because this new world is one won by Janes of all trade. It encourages experiential nuance \\u0026 a ‘build the plane while you’re flying it’ approach to entrepreneurship. What’s most often discussed are [individuals who leave a media company to go and build a brand of their own](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/24/substack-email-newsletter-journalism/). Their background is usually as a writer, designer, editor and they carry their individual reputation from a known publication or Twitter to their new independent business.\\n\\nBut the opposite is also happening; [entrepreneurial minds who have built businesses at established companies or on their own are also choosing a path to become creators themselves](https://digiday.com/media/how-substack-has-spawned-a-new-class-of-newsletter-entrepreneurs/). So unlike those who have built a career in media or journalism and now decide to become entrepreneurs, there are those who have built a career in business or tech and now decide to become journalists.\\n\\nT**his is what I’m calling the** **age of the** **Renaissance Creator **— the hybridization of the individual as both a creator and an entrepreneur. This development and definition of ‘creativity’ is one of the more interesting things happening today because it is contrary to the *supposed *logic for a creator to go independent. We like to say independence (see: [passion economy](https://li-jin.co/2019/10/22/the-passion-economy-and-the-future-of-work/)) is valuable because it lets a creator focus on what they do best; create. But actually it’s the opposite. By going independent, the creator is aspiring to not only create, but willingly assume the [management and business of their entire self](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1283426952909672450?s=20). This acceptance of responsibility as a formula for success will dictate a creator’s desire to go independent and develop a micro-label or decide to limit duties and create within a larger media organization.\\n\\n*I want to be a creator. I want to be a business. I want to be a brand.*\\n\\nPlatforms have made it more achievable than ever to gain experience vertically within specific categories and port that individual’s reputation horizontally from one network to another. Because of this, all aspiring creators now compete on the same playing field. Each platform is a building block for the individual’s brand and affords them clout and entry into another platform. We’re seeing this happen in real-time across media, with journalists leaving large umbrella media companies to go independent, finding a home to build their core business \\u0026 then extend the reputation of that business to further monetize their own brand, and create their own label.\\n\\n***Newsletters are mixtapes.***\\n\\nThe independent writer business is not new. It’s an evolution from blogging that has now found a home through newsletter platforms like Substack that enable anyone, from any background, the ability to build their own label. If you can write, build an audience \\u0026 manage distribution, you are now a media company. And that transition from creating to becoming an entrepreneur (building an audience, managing distribution) is a phenomenon that’s insanely exciting but also really hard. Platforms like Twitter make this audience building and portability easier, but that’s more attainable on the journalist to entrepreneur track vs. the entrepreneur to journalist track. It’s also evolved the idea of journalism and has invited many unconventional backgrounds of writers into the journalism business.\\n\\nThere is a rally cry from traditional news organizations and media outlets who say “these aren’t journalists!” or “these aren’t media companies!”. Much like a major label wouldn’t consider an indie label competition until it takes their business, the same situation is unraveling in the new creator economy: journalists and writers are leaving institutions to try and build the next evolution of the media business on their own. As larger media companies become labels, their value to the creator needs to supplement the value the creator can attain on their own. In the era of the Renaissance Creator, all definitions are reconsidered. All businesses are reinvented.\\n\\nIf independent writers are like independent artists, newsletters are an entry into the media business like mixtapes are an entry into the music business. That’s because newsletters offer a medium of creation that has no barrier to entry and no production costs other than the willingness for the person to enter the ring and write. The business, the audience, the words, the design, the distribution…EVERYTHING is on the individual to learn, adapt and build on their own. This ownership of responsibility driving the hybridization of the individual is why we’re seeing such a unique mix of creators and journalists taking different paths to becoming stars. But now instead of grabbing a rapper’s CD from the spin rack at an Exxon/Mobil, you’re putting your email in a sign up box and it’s being delivered directly to you.\\n\\nAnd like mixtapes, the newsletter relationship is creating a cult-like following for the creator, turning readers into fans. The fan comes along for the ride as the writer moves from amateur status to stardom and it introduces a relationship with the creator that’s personal. This opens up a ton of opportunities for emerging businesses and, visibly, a possible transition for creator’s as they exit the passion economy and move towards the [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/). When fans are invested in a creator’s success, the economics change for both the creator and the consumer.\\n\\n***A new value on content***\\n\\nThere’s a bizarre connection between what newsletters did for content and what streaming did for music that is worth paying attention to. In today’s media business, content’s value is, well, often valueless. The fuel of the information ecosystem is “breaking news” which is usually released by a larger publication and then runs through the creator lifecycle of syndication, curation, aggregation and then resuscitation. That information is most valuable when it “breaks”, then when there’s commentary on the curation and then it’s worth is dictated by programmatic level CPMs until it fizzles. This has encouraged consumers to believe that content should be free, or at least at some time, available for consumption at no cost.\\n\\nBut this isn’t the same with newsletters. Newsletters have put tangible value on a creator’s work that has allowed them to build a business around both their individual brand and the content that they create. It is both a platform *and *a format. It’s enabled the creator to deliver thoughtful analysis with a consistent point of view. It’s allowed them to create a “micro label” business outside of the management of larger holding companies. It’s valuable.\\n\\n*Let’s compare***: **Readers assume content is free. Music *became* free. Napster wasn’t about making music free as much as it was about user experience and user control. Listeners demanded a better experience and Napster was the catalyst for that. Newsletters, and curation are similar. Out of Napster came streaming. With a new user experience and ability to give listeners control of what they wanted to listen to, they not only stopped stealing music but they started paying for it. The product valued music by the listeners on a level that was lost with the introduction of Napster and earned back again through experience.\\n\\nPrior to this newsletter boom, readers have been doing anything possible to circumvent the payment experience. Again, this isn’t about paying for content but more so about needing control, needing a better experience and thus the casualty of that desire is media companies losing revenue (ad blockers and circumventing paywalls). But what’s incredible with newsletters is, people aren’t looking for ways to steal content. In fact, content is more portable than ever (I forward this email to you) but it’s not being done because the experience and control is finally made available to that particular reader. So much so, that they’re even starting to pay for it.\\n\\nCuration is so similar to playlists — people *steal* content because they don’t want to pay for a bundle subscription in order to read a single article just like people were stealing music because they didn’t want to buy a CD to listen to a single song. New formats breed new models and people value choice. Before streaming, creating custom playlists were difficult and piracy allowed users to curate their own experience. Before newsletters, creating personalized content feeds were difficult but now you, the reader, are able to create your own bundles.\\n\\nAs you can see, not only has this format enabled any creator to enter the venue and launch a media company, but it’s also enabled a new way of thinking of putting value on the creator work which then breeds new business models tied to ownership, consumer relationship (ie. customers are fans) and beyond.\\n\\n***A new value on creator***\\n\\nOptions create value, and what we’re seeing in the creator economy is a recalibration of not just the product that’s produced, but the producers themselves. Traditionally, creators who worked within media organizations were undervalued simply because the reputation is on the company itself. All individuals within the organization contribute to building the business and reputation of the larger holding company, which means individual reputation contribution is difficult to calculate and put value on. It took the Economist 176 years to *finally *[add bylines to some of their content pages](https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-economist-adds-bylines-to-blogs/). The *holy shit! *moment of creator’s realizing that their value \\\\*could\\\\* be larger than it’s getting credit for started with platforms and the ability to accumulate and engage followers directly on platforms. But the emergence of platforms like Substack, OnlyFans, Cameo \\u0026 Patreon have accelerated that and are creating a new market indicator for individuals similar to what free agency does to athletes.\\n\\nLet’s use the NFL as an example. Not every quarterback in the NFL is valued the same because they’re a quarterback in the NFL. There is an open marketplace, free-agency, that leverages a community and auction process to assess the value of a player based on many factors. Before the enablement of creator’s to operate their own businesses in the passion economy, all creator value under the umbrella of a media organization was generalized or, oftentimes, devalued. It seems obvious that all creators are different, like QBs are, yet we value them the same because there has never been a marketplace or venue for the community/readers to openly bid, purchase and set the value of the creator’s work. In this new environment, creator’s take a step further than the QB in that they are now actually in a free-market. Anyone has a shot. Anyone can demand value.\\n\\nWhat we’re seeing with the emergence of these platforms and adoption by creators is the venue for a market dictating ‘value per individual’ creator. Using Substack for example, each writer can set their own price, product \\u0026 expand membership products and benefits any which way. It’s dictated by the creator and the consumer decides whether or not they think it’s valuable. If they agree, the value is set. Before Substack, if an individual writer wrote for a publication, they had no idea what their ‘value per individual’ was. They knew their traffic, or their following on platforms outside of that publication, but internally their value was diluted amongst others.\\n\\nWhat platforms in the passion economy bring is a direct value attribution by the fans to creators that’s dictated by all market factors (competition, content, platform, budget). [As I argued in my last piece](https://medium.com/@jarroddicker/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b), these are benefits that larger media companies need to adopt as the attraction of brand reputation is now second to their ability to be excellent distributors, developers and managers of talent and talent’s product.\\n\\nThese models result in more value for creators, a financial opportunity and business tied to independence and a true value reset on the contributors that make the creative economy run.\\n\\nIn the era of the Renaissance Creator, there are options. As media companies position themselves to put a bigger emphasis on the creator and transition their value proposition to include A\\\\\\u0026R and an opportunity for individuals to build their brand under the larger halo, individuals are entertaining the value of not only going solo but building micro labels themselves. This doesn’t just change the construct of how creators transact and engage with consumers but alters the actual structure of how the business itself is established. The business of the Renaissance Creator and its creation of micro labels may adopt the models of the major labels, iterate on existing business practices or create new ones entirely.\\n\\nA great example of this is around the announcement of The Defector. The team behind Deadspin just announced Tuesday that they’re launching a new media business, The Defector. It’s a 20 person media operation built on top of Pico, Stripe and Mailchimp. It is truly one of the first structured media Co-Ops in that each journalist owns their IP and owns, literally, about ~5% of the company. This means that if one journalist decides to leave, she can, the structure remains intact. This is one of the first examples of creators moving from the passion to the ownership economy, especially if business models begin acknowledging and rewarding participation from their customers.\\n\\nThis business is accelerating.

While this is a problem, it makes sense. The breakthrough idea behind NFTs was that unique digital objects could be owned. So the initial set of applications were those directly involved in buying, selling, and storing. We needed marketplaces to shop and bid and wallets to pay with and hold our purchases. These are experiences that emphasize the private and personal nature of an NFT. But as with owned physical objects, this transactional aspect is only part of appreciating a possession. For any item with utility beyond immediate sustenance and safety, value is created socially. We understand its worth based on what the broader community thinks it’s worth. Right now, the community of people valuing NFTs is only the people making and buying them.  For a sense of scale, the [top 25 decentralized apps](https://dappradar.com/rankings) all together, not just those related to NFTs, probably had less than 250,000 transacting wallet/users over the last 24 hours, and nearly half of these were at Dapper’s Top Shots. For NFTs to reach their true potential, we need to build much farther-reaching consumption experiences. And to not repeat the same mistakes of our current digital era, we need these platforms to maintain a decentralized ethos.\\n\\nAs any asset begins to accrue greater recognition and deeper social significance, its value moves beyond being predominantly transactional and towards an expression of the owner’s identity. Its value transcends the actual product and comes to attribute worth to the owners themself. As this value is socialized, the community starts to not only associate the worth with the product but with the person too. *This is true in the physical world, where the identification with something you own is different from that of something you rent, lease, or borrow*. It is also true with NFTs. But, all of this won’t happen at scale without NFTs reaching and being adopted by the broader community.\\n\\nNFT creators and owners know this, of course. They want as many other people as possible to enjoy and contribute to their products and property. Owners want their possessions to be known, used, loved, and increasingly, remixed. The fact that non-owners can also consume NFT content doesn’t mean that owning them isn’t valuable. It’s the opposite. For example, if an NFT is minted for a particular moment, the more that moment is appreciated the more value the asset tied to that moment accrues. In fact, art owners have \\\\*always\\\\* benefited from public display and reproduction -- because appreciation of art/media/collectibles makes them more valuable, because widespread reproductions elevate the status of the “true” and original; and because widespread dissemination educates the market. This contributes to its culture. Reproducibility is a feature, not a bug. \\n\\nAs such, owners of NFTs have a vested interest in making sure that great third-party consumption experiences exist, especially if their ownership is evident and it can drive more transactions, passion, and engagement to the creator. Broader distribution will even drive new genres and creations built on top of the owned item, similar to hip-hop as a genre (a culture of remixing others’ originals) and the evolution of EDM by way of Dance music in Chicago to EDM in Europe. All of this remixing will make the originals more valuable. But this requires NFTs to be experienced in the first place. Only broad consumption will further the shift of NFTs from digital assets to cultural legacy. When we create awesome applications to share NFTs with this far broader group of people and let them consume them, and we will, the effects will be nothing short of [revolutionary](https://tals.substack.com/p/defi-creators-). \\n\\nUnfortunately, today, those great non-owner experiences barely exist. For art and collectible NFTs, the UX so far consists of marketplaces, social posts to promote sales, some data-driven transaction ranking sites, and crypto-wallets. We have the NFT equivalent of auction houses, media for pro art buyers, and the systems to manage transactions. All of it is geared to buyers or collectors and investors, for bidding and trading. These are not enjoyment-optimized environments. We’re missing the equivalent of museums, concert halls, theaters, and the fashion show that is just walking down the street. \\n\\nThe analogy should not be taken literally. Thanks to nascent ‘crypto worlds,’ there have been some admirable attempts to build three-dimensional museums and galleries. But unless you’re a real VR enthusiast, you probably haven’t been invited to or delighted by the experience. These spaces are inconvenient to navigate, oppressively skeuomorphic, and fail at the central goal of any NFT consumption app: connecting users instantly to the media they are most likely to enjoy. \\n\\nSo what *should* these experiences look like? Well, to start with, they probably aren’t that different from the UXes we currently use for exploring and consuming media on our phones and other screens. Whether you are visiting a site, marketplace, or chat application, NFTs should be integrated into the experience. Each application, based on its purpose, will have a different way of showcasing NFTs to consumers. If it was a player for NFT songs, it might let you listen or navigate by genre or most popular. Or like Zora.fm, just let you swipe to find stuff you liked, maybe getting algorithmically smarter about what you preferred, or letting you create an explicit interest profile. (More about that valuable and dangerous interest data later.) \\n\\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14184519-1e8b-41b0-b486-cfa660fcee07_864x852.png)\\n\\nBut there are also some essential differences about the consumption of NFTs and the needs of the NFT ownership ecosystem. The first is the fact that the owners of the media asset should be recognized. By giving the owner her own place of glory on the UX, we make them an important part of the creation story. This increases the value of ownership, which increases how much an artist can charge. Where we have traditionally lionized labels and studios and by extension the oligarchy of huge corporations that own them, we can instead salute the smaller entrepreneurial collector. And perhaps not only the current owner but the *first* owner, the one who took the initial risk to invest. It makes sense to be able to see what else they own, or have owned in the past, and be able to enjoy that also. Of course, owners might not necessarily be individuals. They can be groups of fans, buying clubs and collectives, perhaps [formalized in a DAO structure](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN\\\\_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI). This can change the way media companies and platforms structure their relationships with both creators and consumers under the value proposition of “ownership”. In this way, a DAO’s current and past media ownership functions both as a playlist and a sort of index fund. \\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030e604c-782d-4183-ab7f-9ac0e7e03b04\\\\_483x259.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030e604c-782d-4183-ab7f-9ac0e7e03b04\\\\_483x259.png)\\n\\nA second difference is the importance of linking to transaction opportunities, both the opportunity to bid on or buy that asset, as well as on related assets. Someone enjoying a comedy routine-NFT might want to bid on an NFT that is a collectible-ticket to the comedian’s upcoming show. This need not interfere with a delightful consumption experience. The app can be entirely optimized for the non-owner while also providing smooth paths to buying and collecting. One intriguing idea connecting both of these differences concerns an owner’s likely desire to more prominently promote an NFT they own, not unlike a featured post in a social media context. Instead of explicitly paying the app for that promotional presence, the owner might instead ‘stake’ the NFT, contributing the resulting revenues to the app. This could be a meaningful amount. As we have seen, highly-valued NFTs generate significant economic flows. \\n\\nThanks to the malleable nature of the NFT standard and the unbroken relationship to a creator, the consumption experience could offer features that today’s media apps do not. A song could have creator-supplied lyrics. Visual art could reveal its underlying layers. A dance routine could include a tutorial. Works could change over time, as programmable entities responding to external stimulus or the presence of other NFTs. Assets that are part of a multi-artist collections could link to the rest of that greater assembly, maybe to other items with similar attributes. Consumption experiences might also pull inspiration from gaming concepts. NFTs could ‘compete’ against each other in contests and tournaments: dance-offs, rap battles, song of the summer countdowns, jury-selected film awards. Prizes and promotion would flow back to the owners and creators. We will also see NFT displays designed for public places, restaurants, stores and clubs. Venues might even receive revenue from digital purchases when we once again gather in-person.  \\n\\nAs these apps are likely to offer personalization, driven by explicit or implicit interests or social graph, one important question is how user data should be managed. Some developers will opt to store the data on their own servers, the way Twitter, Facebook, Spotify and Tiktok do now. The performance benefits are significant, and it’s a huge competitive advantage. In the near term, apps that ‘own the user’ will be more convenient to access and more valuable to investors, partners and advertisers. The danger is that one of these apps uses that advantage to become so big that they cripple the NFT ownership economy. A dominant NFT-app might, for example, demand onerous percentages of transactions driven through its UX or push NFTs in which it had a large ownership stake. Some argue that this outcome is acceptable, provided that artists and owners themselves participate in the equity or revenues of the app through tokens, perhaps granted on the basis and extent of their participation. This may be short-sighted. The widespread adoption of decentralized identity systems, preventing no one app from dominating the last-mile of data ownership, is probably the best way of ensuring a competitive landscape in which artists and collectors get the best deal. Hopefully, prominent NFT creators and investors will loudly advocate for this practice.\\n\\nBut does it matter? What if, as might be expected, the current data-hoarding giants simply add NFTs into their own experiences? Or if they buy and integrate one of these new upstart apps? The dismal journey from the idealism of ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Web 2.0 to our current oligarchic Internet provides plenty of source material for pessimism. RSS was co-opted and killed by Google, then repackaged and controlled by Twitter and Facebook. Podcasting may be headed in the same direction. History rhymes and regulators tend to act too late and too clumsily to be a savior. The open question, and the spring of optimism if you choose to believe, is whether the new incentives of ownership have forever changed the equation. Do creators and owners, having tasted the fruits of independence, refuse to accept the ‘bad old’ deal? Do developers use the enormous power of the blockchain and DeFi to continue to fund and grow exciting and more equitable offerings? Do all of us consciously orient our media habits towards the ecosystems that most effectively promote broad creative prosperity? If we do, it won’t matter whether Instagram, Tiktok or Spotify becomes the most popular way to consume NFT content. Because to do so, those platforms will be forced to accept a culture of artist and collector control. Nothing is inevitable.\\n\\nThe NFT market is exploding upwards as speculators, builders, artists, promoters, and others see the opportunity to take advantage of the shift towards decentralized creation and distribution. At the same time, consumers are adopting the technology as they discover NFTs are [proof of passion](https://tals.substack.com/p/proof-of-passion), digitized tokens that prove commitment, interest, support thereby conferring status. But despite the eye-popping prices and insane growth, the market remains underdeveloped. It’s not surprising that people outside the collector cohort think the speculation is weird, and maybe even a little gross. We have yet to really build out how you consume, display and enjoy your collection as anything more than just storing it in your closet or vault or purchasing it on an exchange. *If NFTs crash and burn as a bubble, this will be why.* Only building for the consumption side will enable mass adoption, which will in turn support a loop of creation, ownership, consumption and creation that will power the next wave of media and social infrastructure. As these layers get built, there is an opportunity to avoid some of the centralized challenges of our current consumption and creation stacks and build a more creator-friendly, equitable future. But we have to choose to build it that way.\\n\\n/Credit to [Dennis Crowley](https://twitter.com/dens) for the header photo.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nhere's an NFT for you to own. shop local. \\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/25381014852418948805889093397553910691723421696921342528988486403015055507466)\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\",\"timestamp\":1615216368,\"title\":\"NFTs Need an Audience: Utility, Consumption and Building New Worlds\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\",\"body\":\"![](https://external-preview.redd.it/KRvJe99Df2drWk2SeW4BFGwDKkHz8KTk5q0G12saOQk.jpg?auto=webp\\u0026s=9cb8bd777f3aaad099efb4fcc6e08d3003455768)\\n\\n***a [jarroddicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker), [flynnjamm](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) \\u0026 [patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera) joint***\\n\\nMedia companies are talent companies. As that becomes increasingly obvious to the media industry at large, there has been an acceleration of development by both challengers and incumbents to position themselves to capture media's most critical natural resource: people.\\n\\nThe creator economy served as a catalyst to disrupt legacy structures by introducing platforms \\u0026 products that enable individuals to build a business around themselves. There are many reasons why individuals want to go independent which I explain in detail here ([Media Companies as Record Labels](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b)) and here ([Rise of the Renaissance Creator](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/media-2020-rise-of-the-renaissance-creator-459daec4bc6b)), which introduce a variety of opportunities for both the talent and existing media institutions. The rapid development of platforms and services that empower individuals to build a business around themselves is a major one. Top talent wants more control and ownership over their work, having options to transcend their reputation and financial success from a parent brand.\\n\\nBut independence is really hard. The creator economy has invited criticism of creator burnout, lack of necessary support and an absence of strategic and educational resources for individuals to better guide themselves in isolation. While there is accelerated development in the creator economy to fulfill those needs, there’s another economy being built that is positioned to extend the promise of the new media structure even further.  \\n\\nThe ownership economy-- by way of decentralized autonomous organizations aka DAOs + non-fungible tokens aka NFTs-- builds a business on top of the creator economy that encourages creators, operators and the community to collaborate together under a new, interdependent ownership mechanism that combines the best of both (legacy + creator economy) worlds and then some.\\n\\nThis new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside. \\n\\nTo think of this pragmatically, let’s look at TV shows. Actors, actresses, producers and writers are free agents and sign deals for specific series on many platforms. Each series builds its own identity, reputation and community. The individuals that contribute to the show are free to work on other projects and may even be encouraged to in order to increase their own and the show's reputation (marketing!). This interoperability makes everything the individual touches more valuable. As I said in past posts, the new media structure starts to look more like record labels or in the example above, production studios, rather than traditional brand structures.\\n\\nSo back to creator DAOs and NFTs. The introduction of creator DAOs means that both the creators, its support, its contributors \\u0026 its audience are all owners in the collective. It means that every operation, and participants in the operation, are now shareholders. Today, creators can be owners in a media company by way of equity, but that’s often limited by the role each individual plays. As a result, once talented individuals build a strong enough reputation, they're incentivized to negotiate contracts or go independent to retain more ownership over their work. Media companies are starting to think about how they build a more welcome environment for those creators, but they’re developing in parallel to challenger structures like creator DAOs. DAOs present an alternative organizational structure that tries to align incentives for the long-term among a variety of stakeholders. The relationship changes from creator and consumer to everyone as co-creators. Creative organizations begin to look more like flat peer-to-peer networks as opposed to hierarchies. Everyone who contributes to the media company is a co-creator; the creator, support staff and community.\\n\\nThis is possible because the media company (collective) itself is a crowdfund of its creators, supporters and community members. All participators invest in the entity which results in a token, the “equity” of DAOs. All revenue across advertising, subscriptions, events and other means is then pooled to a treasury where all cash inflows and outflows are recorded publicly. There is a universal share in the ownership. \\n\\nWhere NFTs come in is that all digital assets created by the DAO are minted as NFTs. Through that, every asset becomes managed, monitored and owned. This means that creators, operators and participants are all collaborators on the NFT asset. Outside of pure ownership and participation, this means that an asset returns royalties based on the performance of the content, delivering returns for participants in perpetuity.\\n\\nWhat’s not often discussed, but is a real struggle in the existing media space, is the value attributed to creative assets. As media moved from print to digital, creative assets have lost the ability to control and maintain value throughout the web ecosystem. With NFTs, digital media now becomes a liquid financial asset secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts. \\n\\nCurrently, each creator receives royalties in perpetuity when their NFTs are sold on the secondary market. [As Flynn explains in his latest piece](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/-xYcfFRlhDdLDSUgRMTYJAaRJBs2VG4LP34DnOV84mI), NFT creators in the future will have two paths: independent or collective. As an independent, creators can realize the full upside of their NFT creations and earn built-in royalties. But the collective model is an entirely new way to build distribution. Because the NFTs are programmable, the royalties can be broken down further into fractional shares. Instead of a creator earning their full share of royalties on share, they can distribute royalties to agents or collectives, who can help the creator gain distribution opportunities for the NFT.\\n\\nLet’s get pragmatic again-- Similar to that IMDB is a database of media attached to a single creator or operator, the ledger will now provide a graph representing the creator or operator to every piece of media they are associated with or a contributor to. When the NFT is sold, all creators who were part of the DAO are time stamped with a block number, representing a creator’s affiliation with the process or moment in time they were a part of.\\n\\nBut there’s more. Another benefit of NFTs is that they turn digital media into public goods with pseudonymous ownership. A digital media file that’s minted as an NFT can be read by everyone, but owned as a collectible by a single entity. This provides a new monetization channel for digital media without limiting growth by putting content behind a paywall. It also revitalizes business models that used to be lucrative in the print era but lost in the digital era like the wire service. \\n\\nThere are parallel efforts throughout the media and tech ecosystem to try and get to the same place; how do we evolve the media’s infrastructure to draw benefit for the talent, the support and the community? In order to capitalize on providing an infrastructure that benefits all parties, the foundation needs to be broken down and built back up again. It’s very hard to renovate a business, especially one that hasn’t been built on the criteria for the new era. The creator economy started tearing down the foundation of legacy media’s structure to encourage both existing media companies and new entrants to think about building for and enabling talent based companies. As both businesses begin to map out the next iteration of their technical and business architecture, there is infrastructure being mapped out that is ripe for all economies to be built on top of-- the ownership economy. \\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n***Support your local artists***\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/1688)\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\",\"timestamp\":1614618595,\"title\":\"A New Media Structure: The Ownership Economy\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}},{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"member\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}}},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[],\"_id\":\"9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\",\"body\":\"![Trey Anastasio, Phish, Nashville 2018](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/25cafc24-71f1-4f50-93e6-02ada2762b21.jpeg?height=1620\\u0026width=2160)\\n\\nIf media companies are record labels and creators are rock stars then the audience are fans — and that introduces an entirely new business opportunity.\\nMedia, like music, can only thrive when the audience and the creator travel down a path together, giving each other the opportunity to define one another. It’s a two-way street, not a top-down dictum. But what happens when a creator or artist gets so big that their audience starts building products on top of their work?\\n\\nThe media’s status quo is accelerating towards disruption. We’re seeing the development of new media brands (micro-labels) on platforms and services, the prioritization of talent as a core business pillar by media companies and the shifting business models moving from content direct to creator direct.\\n\\nAs each component of creation evolves, there is another evolution happening with the most critical part of the media business’ formula: the consumers. In the media business, business models drive product strategy. And while that’s the driving force behind the product, it’s contingent on consumer interest, participation and loyalty. That means that as the economy shifts, so needs the consumer value. This is an opportunity to build a new business that puts the creator and consumer relationship front and center and introduces the element of ownership. This is the business of fandom and subcultures.\\n\\nCreators should be in the business of eliciting and manufacturing subculture.\\n\\nSubcultures develop as a response to a pre-existing culture. In the case of music and media, that pre-existing culture or categorization is the genre. The desire to fit within a pre-existing genre, traditionally, has been beneficial for the artist. Genres set the taste broadly for what the listener or reader should expect from the artist or creator within that category. There is an existing audience, an existing business model — the foundation is set.\\n\\nThe goal is to bust through genres and create a subgenre (subcultures) of its own. Think of it on both sides: the creator (or label) develops their own identity in response to genre a la Sub-Pop and the fans develop their own identity and subculture in response to it a la Punk. In the era of niche, the approach is quite the opposite. Instead of creating for the broader audience, the fashion is now to style the particular few. It’s less about scale and more about the quality of the audience who wants it. By doing this, not only do creators open up a unique pocket of value for themselves but their community starts to construct an identity out of the value that’s been created.\\n\\nThe relationship between creator and consumers is more valuable than its transactional currency (ie. content). In this era of media, the content is not the only product. The content is a key part of the value in that it’s the tool for consistency but the creator and the community are the product. The true value is the connection between consumer and creator acquired through a variety of access points that eventually develop a consumer benefit. As the business moves from content is value to creator is value we should shift the business opportunities that support it as well.\\nThe consumer builds on the brand.\\n\\nCreators should be in the business of eliciting and manufacturing subculture. For a creator, culture is when their brand is so transportable, that commerce and community are built outside of the creator itself. If membership enables identity, and identity builds brand then culture is eternal. When the consumers become the creators and associate their value with not just building within the creator environment but outside of it as well, the creator becomes a platform. Businesses are being built on top of the creator, separate from their participation because of the consumers commitment and dedication to their brand. The creator is the platform. In this example, the relationship is not just with the content, the creator and the community, but in the development of a subculture itself. The audience isn’t a commodity. Instead, the audience views themself as a part of the brand, and associate their own ideas with their consumption and engagement with the creator. An example of this is the band Phish.\\n\\nThrough the music, brand and community of Phish, an entire subculture has developed around the group to the point where there are businesses, identities and communities built outside of the band’s direct participation. Phish is the creator but the nature of their creation (ie. music and community) and their development of culture has turned their fans into creators themselves. They can leverage the Phish audience to develop their own audiences, thus expanding the brand and culture. Like The Grateful Dead’s shakedown scene, Phish has built themselves as a platform for consumers (in this case fans) to build their business on top of. As a result, the brand becomes immortal through their association in the foundation of the community’s business. In the Phish subculture, there are many fan built establishments across a variety of trades.\\n\\nThere is Phish.net run by Scott Marks and team that compile set-lists, news and analysis on the band and their associated projects in real-time. Phantasy Tour, a reddit-esque forum developed by fans for fans has become the defacto platform for all fans to discuss… anything. Here, a fan (and one of my dear friends), is seeking mid-century modern furniture for his new house. The first post maxed out at 499 responses (499’d!) and it spilled over to a second thread. He chose to have this conversation on Phantasy Tour and found the perfect chair.\\n\\nThere is a completely robust ecosystem of commerce developed, designed and distributed by fans. The band influenced, independent and run JEMP Radio and Phish Just Jams are music applications built on top of the catalog to service a particular interest, a particular niche. Fan photographers have built an entire business and reputation around their art, one of my favorites being AZN. There’s even a physical marketplace for commerce at live events in the cities the band plays in. Beyond commerce, there are a lot of societal benefits to the growing subculture. For example, the Phellowship is a fan lead group of fans who choose to be drug and alcohol free.\\n\\nIn the culture Phish defined, the subculture now dictates the identity and longevity of the brand in its ability to live in perpetuity. The fans themselves are defining the culture as well as the brand through business. Granted, this took over 30 years and compounds all the time.\\n\\nFunny enough, this entire movement towards the creator economy with the unbundling and rebundling of media operations and platforms is itself a media subculture. Creators and supporting platforms and services are looking to challenge the interpretive authority of media institutions and their structure by building providence of their own. For some creator’s it’s less about the business and more about the desire to break through the establishment and promote individual freedom and construct an environment of their own. Many that go independent could potentially earn less than if they stayed at an establishment, but that’s not the point. And this is a signal both for how incumbents need to prepare against challengers and how businesses need to be set up to provide a platform for subculture momentum.\\n\\nA business of subculture and fandom has always existed in music. Phish has taken it to the next level by not only making their consumers creators, but also making them owners. They are very much in the lead here and, against the strong insistence of opportunity in this piece, will be difficult replicate.\\nThe media business has traditionally been built around content. There have been hints of culture driven commerce throughout the years in the NYT blue bag, the New Yorker tote bag, but most of these attempts teetered on the edge of membership and nowhere near the manufacturing of subcultures. We are seeing new media companies begin to work towards this opportunity of moving consumer identity down the line from someone who subscribes, to someone who’s a member, to someone who sees the brand as part of their culture. As business models drive product strategy, the business of manufacturing subculture can’t just be a phenomenon, it must also be a source of brand growth. Encouraging fandom and moving to an environment where consumers become the creators is insurance and future proofing your brand.\\n\\nSubcultures happen organically with time but they can be pushed towards a direction and accelerated. This tied simply to the idea of brand — in order to drive culture, your brand must have a point of view. In order to drive subculture, you must elicit a response from your consumer who themselves have a point of view. A way to trigger this is to unlock your brand. Rights management is important, and culture is driven through commerce, but holding it too tight means you forfeit earned media potential and the ability for your consumer to become a creator. Consumers becoming creators are good for your brand, especially if it’s built with your brand in mind. The end goal is to have the brand be so associated with the consumer identity, that some even model their life, or business, around it.\\n\\nAnother great example is the agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, Big Hit. They recently listed their initial public offering and it had been massively oversubscribed by both institutional and retail investors. Fans are literally investing in the artists success and are incentivized for them to do well. The fourth wall is breaking.\\n\\nBTS Won't Stay Forever Young. The K-Pop Sensation's Owner Needs New Big Hits.\\nKorean pop music, or K-pop, has taken the world by storm. It is shaking up the financial markets, too. \\n\\nThere are many emerging creators that are building culture through community that, through time and commitment, will elicit subculture. As defined and showcased above, the business of subculture is different from the development of subculture. This is about reversing the flow of expectations about the fans role from a passive consumer to an actual business creator. There is a lot of momentum in the gaming space, especially with the commerce, branding and communities being built by the likes of MrBeast and Ninja, and my expectation is that this is the obvious next phase in their brand expansion.\\n\\nThe environment has changed and so have the platforms. This opportunity is truly rooted in the digital landscape. As media companies work to become record labels and independent creators start their own brands, or collaborate with others to create their own micro label, the business models should follow. As we unbundle and rebundle the operational structure of what a media company is, we should equally unbundle and rebundle the way we drive that business and where we put the emphasis of value. As explained above, that’s a move from content as value to creator as value. And as we shift further away from content and towards the creator, the existing structure of subscription and membership will limit the opportunity for a brand to expand in this next age.\\n\\nSo we enter the business of subculture with a focus on building a brand as a platform. Those that invest in brokering deeper connections with their fans, and enabling them to become creators on behalf of a brand will be way ahead of the curve. There is an incredible opportunity ahead of us in the media industry and I’m excited to see what you all build.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\",\"timestamp\":1610660306,\"title\":\"Breaking the Fourth Wall: The Business of Media Subculture\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267}}],\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"projectAddress\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"__APOLLO_STATE__\":{\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"address\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4a6d1d2-c3c5-4ded-891a-5aa02b699e90.jpeg?height=168\\u0026width=300\",\"description\":\"Shall we go, you and I while we can\",\"displayName\":\"Dark Star\",\"domain\":\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"darkstar.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"INDIGO\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"},\"posts\":[{\"__ref\":\"entry:zKO5g95VOExNHYe-fSpRQj92928gO3yse77rO_fYFXw\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:XdzGaKgCMXmm7Xgaai_u4-iv7MCjF025sip_TJSDrVo\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:VTLvmo0xzs6I9YFIN2f7EZna-Zj4tNIEbF7RVpJOS7s\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\"},{\"__ref\":\"entry:9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\"}]},\"ProjectType:0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"address\":\"0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0a3ef6b7-0ab8-4fe0-a60f-6cd171849e49.jpg?height=3088\\u0026width=2316\",\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Jonathanglick\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null},\"entry:zKO5g95VOExNHYe-fSpRQj92928gO3yse77rO_fYFXw\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"zKO5g95VOExNHYe-fSpRQj92928gO3yse77rO_fYFXw\",\"body\":\"press play before you begin …\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsHsUoxA9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsHsUoxA9CU)\\n\\n\\u003e “There are going to be times when we can't wait for somebody.

We like to talk about how blockchains are *like* cities. About how [tokens](https://www.citycoins.co) and [DAOs](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA) can improve the governance and economy of cities. And about building new cities in the [Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) and even in the [real world](https://www.praxissociety.com/content/introducing-praxis). But recently, in the context of [NYC NFT](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/nfts-take-over-nyc/) and [Solana Lisbon](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/solana-throws-a-three-day-party-for-itself/) and now [Art Basel-Miami](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/12/01/art-and-crypto-a-marriage-made-in-miami), a new urban crypto phenomenon has become clear: the moving city.\\n\\nIndividuals, small project teams, packs of enthusiasts, investors and entrepreneurs, all of them descend on a single geographic location, and for a week or so, make a city within a city. They gather for discussions, presentations and parties. Most importantly, they gather to do *work*. In hotel lobbies and coffee shops, people meet to advance the collaborations they mainly pursued online. In night clubs and bars, they meet to dance and drink and play. It was as if Manhattan and Brooklyn, at least in certain neighborhoods, became an IRL version of their Twitter timelines, Discords and Slacks. What was even more remarkable was how many of the same people reappeared only a few weeks later in Lisbon, regrouping into the same kind of brainstorms and collab sessions. It was like a migration.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/41R6kxOlhBqC6punRaBzN.jpeg?height=980\\u0026width=1485)\\n\\nIn retrospect, this development should have been obvious and predictable. It’s a natural progression. Trade fairs are as old as recorded history. Industry conferences and off-sites are both antecedents. And the combination of Zoom presence and Airbnb as a source of easy to access live/work/play residences made remote employment from anywhere practical. But what really makes the moving city inevitable is the nature of work, and of building, on the blockchain. The crypto get-together is a unique social form: sort of a trade show, sort of an academic conference but, most importantly, also sort of a *company offsite*, where employees meet people from other teams in their big corporation, bond, build morale and get inculcated into company culture. The web3 conference is all of those forms at once, because blockchain projects are distinct and competitive while being deeply cooperative in the way departments in a company are all working ultimately to increase the value of the overall enterprise (and stock price.)\\n\\nYou can be based anywhere with broadband, working with their various project teams and DAOs through collaboration tools, Zoom and Metaverse-y like spaces, and then on a regular basis, perhaps as often as eight to ten times a year, converge on a fun location for a major blockchain event. It could be for several weeks or as long as necessary as new efforts spring up from the fertile cross-pollination of in-person engagement. The availability of residential style rentals makes a longer stay pleasant, less like a frantic trade show and more conducive to real work and relationship-building. And it’s awesome: why stay in one place? Why not see the world, and your friends, while doing what you love? It’s not a coincidence that event-hopping from wonderful locale to wonderful locale mimics the emerging experience and architecture of the Metaverse, and vice versa.\\n\\nA powerful driver of this is that many attendees aren’t *really* meeting for the first time. A large number of them have been in constant contact for months, even years. They have invested together, built together, ‘woken up’ every morning with the daily routine of a ‘gm’ to their online collaborators. Crypto people, especially if they are young, have been building their entire careers and fortunes with people they’ve probably never seen in person, and the ability to make that friendship closer is rich with meaning. It is emotional, significant for their mental health, even spiritual.\\n\\nThere are also parallels between how web3 enthusiasts approach conferences and the way that they approach centralized social networks. As much as there’s a desire to spin out and develop something new, there’s also the awareness – and deliberate strategic choice – that most word-of-mouth recruiting and collaborating needs to happen where people currently are. Let’s look at Twitter for instance: the amount of energy and time spent by folks in web3 to talk about decentralization and the need for a “new Twitter” *on Twitter* is rampant. But recognizing that these existing communities are where the potential opportunity lies (marketing + recruiting), the centralized social services are key tools to get more people aware and involved, “on the bus”. The same goes for physical cities. While web3 boasts an ability to live truly online, there’s a strong desire to leverage the venues offline as they are as, if not more, important in building a truly connected culture that exists outside the the programming of web3 communities.\\n\\nAll this has a powerful impact on the places being ‘temporarily occupied.’  When something comes to your city, you pay attention. When Phish plays a festival in rural Maine or New York, weeks of local coverage and small business preparation is done in lieu of the masses parachuting down into the town. But what this also does is spark the conversation. Yes, there are many who opt into these experiences, who are fluent and are already ‘on the bus.’ But the ‘what’ becomes less important than the ‘why’ when it comes to bringing more awareness and participation to the movement.\\n\\n\\u003e **[“eternal joy and never ending splendor.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HoDlGNTisI)**\\n\\nThis phenomenon is very analogous to that of touring fans. Like Phish, the Dead, BTS and other acts that have built a culture around their trade, the show itself isn’t the main event. The show is the catalyst of getting people together, an excuse to congregate with like minded people at a moment in time and take that energy with them back to their “homes” once it’s over. And when done right, this desire to connect never ends. It is very rare to be able to break the fourth wall in such a way where the community itself leverages a “thing” to drive action, but the culture itself is sustained and maintained without the “thing” needing to be present at all.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p0Vd0C5hkaz7txa4am-iL.png?height=530\\u0026width=800)\\n\\nAnd like touring fans and their bands, each stop is an opportunity to get more folks to hop on the bus. In a culture built on virtual land, without a catalyst to see and feel in person, it’s seemingly prohibitive for many to deeply “get it” and take the time to learn. On the most obvious level, online puts most of the onus on the product, technology and platforms that unlock this feeling of web3. And because of where we are in the web3 lifecycle (it’s early!), it can be discouraging for most to take the time to deeply understand why this world is more fun. The human elements of connection and collaboration are seemingly being worked on, but it’s a lot easier to understand where you’re there. So much so that many who are the most deep in this space never want to miss a “show.” They make sure they’re there, to see their friends, partners and recruit more individuals who are interested, excited in sharing the same ideals of a new world.\\n\\nWhere there is unique nuance is that the idea of a ‘company’ in web3 culture transcends that of a single project or practice. Typically at these conferences, each individual is representative of their brand and is there to sell something. In this case of web3, everyone is there for the proverbial company “web3” or “Bitcoin” or “Ethereum” or “Solana” or… you get it. The purpose of it is to connect with others who are building towards a shared goal, versus sell others on a competitive edge. Sure that happens, but that’s not why people are there. Being in the same “room” as others offers the ability to partner deeper and collaborate for the bigger purpose. The company itself is the movement that everyone is collectively constructing.\\n\\nAnd then, like the circus, it’s over. The tents are packed away. The company disaggregates and people go back to wherever home is. But only temporarily, because there’s another gathering only a few weeks or months away, in some other enticing location, with some new tantalizing theme or mission. It’s likely these events will become more numerous and bigger as this transformation continues: a great circuit of tribal migration, of creators, investors, activists and collectors moving together around the globe.\\n\\n*the bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began.*\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"zKO5g95VOExNHYe-fSpRQj92928gO3yse77rO_fYFXw\",\"timestamp\":1638463789,\"title\":\"Crypto World Tour 2022: The Moving City of Friends \",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\"}],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:XdzGaKgCMXmm7Xgaai_u4-iv7MCjF025sip_TJSDrVo\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"XdzGaKgCMXmm7Xgaai_u4-iv7MCjF025sip_TJSDrVo\",\"body\":\"*press “play” before you begin…*\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8AfIeJOxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt8AfIeJOxw)\\n\\nIt’s not very helpful to make direct comparisons between the evolution of technologies. Other than broad similarities in the way new inventions evolve and are adopted, the unique way a technology interacts with a culture at a particular moment in history is so specific that such comparisons likely miss more than they predict. But there is something resonant in analogies between the dissemination of the ‘original’ Internet (in, say, the 1990s), the social components of Web2 and the present-day rise of blockchain technologies. The commonality is *evident*. This is why crypto folks refer to those early Internet days so often. Both represent, in their own ways daunting and inspiring, a *radical* re-architecture of communications and commerce.\\n\\nThis analogous radical ambition of the early Internet and what we often call Web3 today results in some similar implications for users. Rather than being able to employ existing technologies to participate in the new wave of culture, individuals and organizations are encouraged to learn and adopt new means to coordinate and participate in cultural evolution. In the early 1990s, adventurous internet hobbyists  were faced with the challenges of setting up modems, installing socket drivers, and finding and navigating servers with unique and obscure commands. Each of these steps required self motivation and was in itself a hurdle. Each step, offered with minimal support, was a barrier to adoption. Like today, the early internet required a maverick mindset to push beyond the existing comfort zone. Even for those wary of comparisons, this similarity to Web3 is undeniable. \\n  \\n Blockchain advocates like us often frame these frustrations as an optimistic portent. If the path of the original Internet proves that the complexities of onboarding millions of users to a whole new paradigm will eventually be overcome, then the payoff will be significant. But the comparison tends to take the long term view of that path without examining the steps along the way. In particular, scant attention is being paid to the actual way most early consumers were able to comprehend and access the Internet. In the early internet, this function emerged through online services and particularly, through [America Online](https://www.aol.com/).\\n\\nIt’s difficult now to remember how confusing computers, let alone the Internet, were for most users in the mid-90s. Even by 1997, [only 35%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/1999/apr/wk1/mobile/art01.htm) of US households had a computer. For many of those early adopters, the value proposition of the Internet, most importantly email, was compelling, but ‘getting online’ was so time-consuming and complicated that it required hands-on help to set up. It was into this capability gap that the online services emerged.\\n\\n![source: https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/1999/apr/wk1/mobile/art01.htm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3orm9oifJxYvAWnEredEP.gif?height=238\\u0026width=401)\\n\\nThe first online services launched in the 1980s, long before there was commercial access to the Internet. These services offered text-based UXes for chat, bulletin boards, stock quotes and other content but, for the most part, users could only ‘email’ with other users of the same service. Once the Internet became generally available in 1992, online services like DELPHI, Compuserve and Prodigy (most of which had merged and mutated by this time) became a key way, along with independent ISPs, for users to access this much larger world. They enjoyed modest success. \\n\\nAmerica Online was the breakthrough. With a lineage dating to 1983 — providing games for the Atari, later the Commodore 64, then partnering with Apple on an online service — by the early 90s, the company had determined a strategy. It would be the easiest way for non-technical people to get online. In retrospect, this decision, which led to all of America Online’s subsequent (extremely ambitious) product design and marketing tactics, seems like an obvious choice. But it only does so if you assume the Internet is a mass market product that needs a mass market on-ramp. It was not at all unreasonable at the time to assert the opposite: that the Internet was a powerful tool for specialized and/or eccentric users (ham radio was a common comparison), and that the distribution strategy should reflect that. It was reasonable to believe that it could not or should not be made easy or that this was only possible to a limited extent. \\n  \\n America Online took the other side of that bet -- even at the risk of looking stupid or antagonizing the small but ideologically-committed existing community of Internet users. Whenever it was possible to eliminate a step in the onboarding process, they did. When the brilliant marketer Jan Brandt recognized that limited access to America Online’s software was inhibiting growth, she led [the most audacious disk distribution campaign in history](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/how-much-did-all-of-those-aol-cds-cost/68600/). “At one point, 50% of the CD’s produced worldwide had an AOL logo on it. We were logging in new subscribers at the rate of one every six seconds.” Then, in 1996, they went farther and got the software pre-loaded into Windows 95. When the company’s testers determined that users needed buttons to look like buttons, every important UX control was given bevels and drop-shadows, and design aesthetics be damned. Internet concepts like ‘BBS’ and ‘gopher’ were never invoked by name. Trusted content brands were promoted via well-known metaphors like ‘channels.’ \\n\\nUnderneath the design and marketing, everything was optimized for performance and user engagement. America Online built out a massive 1-800 network, so users’ modems would always be able to find an open phone line. They preloaded massive amounts of graphics on those ubiquitous disks, so that users wouldn’t need to wait for images to load. Ted Leonsis, whose company Steve Case acquired in 1994 and who led many of these moves, once said: “I spend most of my time dumbing things down.” There’s no more famous and appropriate example than the audio that rewarded users who logged back into the service again and again. In three simple words, it proclaimed the payoff: “You’ve got mail!”\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyUwDjgn_wmMf6l1YJLsV.png?height=383\\u0026width=612)\\n\\nThese moves worked. From 1993 to 1996, America Online rocketed from only 300,000 subscribers to 8 million. For the first time in the history of the Internet, a company had achieved ‘scale.’ Its slogan, “So easy to use, it’s no wonder it’s #1,” was accurate. When it launched a browser, AOL.com became the [biggest website](https://slate.com/technology/2009/02/the-unrecognizable-internet-of-1996.html) (by far), not because there was anything interesting on it, but because it was the default. And then, in what amounted to the *coup de grace* to the online services industry, America Online switched to all-you-can-eat pricing. (The flat fee was so popular that it overwhelmed the company’s modems, leading states attorneys-general to force AOL to take down the ‘Jetsons’ ad that promoted the deal.) By 1998, America Online was able to buy its remaining competitors, even including Web pioneer Netscape. America Online’s vision -- ease of use, at all cost -- had won.  \\n  \\n To what extent are we now, in the popularization of blockchain technology, at an ‘America Online moment?’ For consumers, the difficulty of participating in crypto services is certainly similar to the Internet of the early 90s. Two exceptional companies stand out as being easy enough to recommend to non-crypto friends: [Dapper](https://www.google.com/search?q=dapper+labs\\u0026rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US959\\u0026oq=dapper+labs\\u0026aqs=chrome..69i57j46i199i433i465i512j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.2288j0j9\\u0026sourceid=chrome\\u0026ie=UTF-8) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). But we are very much still in a pre-consumer phase of Web3. While there are games emerging (see: [Axie](https://axieinfinity.com/)), and pockets of user attention in corners of Web3 tied to particular interests, there remains a massive non-technical gap in comprehension and onboarding. Most practical use cases are narrow in appeal, like digital sports collectibles and coin/token investing. The value of America Online was driving user onboarding in a way that showcased what the internet could unlock across a variety of interests and industries. Blockchain protocols and products today lack that user onramp. Bottom line:\\n\\n\\u003e **There’s no single America Online-style solution that gets the newbie simple and comprehensive access to the best of the blockchain.**\\n\\nTo this claim, we can expect protests from both crypto skeptics and enthusiasts. The skeptics would argue that the analogy makes no sense, at least not yet, because there’s no crypto value proposition as useful as email, instant messaging or web browsing. From this perspective, it doesn’t matter how easy you make accessing ‘the blockchain,’ if for most people there’s no imminent imperative to do so. On the other side, enthusiasts might argue that onboarding problems are being slowly but surely solved by the crypto community, and that no dramatic simplification, no ‘dumbing down’ from outsiders, would ever work. The nature of decentralization, after all, rejects attempts at singular solutions. Dumbing down has always necessitated the transfer of sovereignty from the user to the platform. \\n\\nThese opposing points, perhaps paradoxically, both ring true. And it's not difficult to see how they might interact to constrain the market. Decentralization leads to difficulty of use which leads to a relatively small number of tech-savvy crypto users which in turn leads to a limited number of use-cases. And, in a context entirely *unlike* the early Internet, the vast amount of money sloshing around the blockchain compounds this ‘problem.’ To put another way, it’s lucrative for crypto developers to provide services for the small number of comparably wealthy and sophisticated users already onboard. They don’t need to solve getting newbies ‘onchain’ to be profitable.\\n\\nSo it’s interesting to consider what the Steve Case, Ted Leonsis and Jan Brandt of today would build on the blockchain. To begin with, we can be fairly confident that it would focus on NFTs. Why? Because even though we’re early in its development, it is already evident that collecting and trading ‘things’ is more compelling to mainstream users and more adaptable to everyday life than abstract ‘currencies.’\\n\\nImagine a service organized around categories, like hobbies, sports, health and so on. In each category, there would be products users could purchase, though lots of them would be ‘freebies,’ mostly from brands that users recognized, like fashion houses, film and video game franchises, sports teams and cooking shows. These would range from digital services, like a paid podcast or Q\\u0026A helpline, to a physical thing, like shoes or cookware, or tickets to an online or real-life event. These would all be items in NFT collections, although the platform might be called something else. When users bought one, they would have access to a community of other people who also owned them. Imagine buying a piece of exercise equipment and having access to a chat room, message boards, and community events, populated by the company and its fans. All of the NFTs a user owns would be  organized in her/his profile (wallet). They would be default private but users could choose to make them viewable to friends. If they were physical/real-world products, users might choose to redeem them for delivery, in which case the NFT would become a stub for returns. Users might choose to sell their NFTs, if they lost interest in the product and/or if the prices for them increased in value, and this would be easily managed through the interface. Most importantly, users would receive notifications of products they would be likely to want to buy or trade for, all based on the contents of their profiles. \\n\\n[https://www.edge.org/conversation/ted_leonsis-digerati-chapter-18](https://www.edge.org/conversation/ted_leonsis-digerati-chapter-18)\\n\\nToday, much of this is slowly happening within an increasingly large community of crypto-curious. The AIM screen name is being [replaced with PFPs](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/pfp-nfts-future-market-1234602384/). Chat rooms have migrated beyond communication centers to be coordinated businesses between community members by way of DAOs. Purchasing is made ‘simple’ through wallets, and offers an interoperable experience for being able to buy and hold across the entire internet. And purchase power is put in the hands of the originators themselves, setting rules on price and contracts for secondary markets to build a business around virality and recirculation. You can argue these early attempts on social structures and community were driven by influence of the AOL days, but lean heavily on the ability to do this everywhere rather than just a specific somewhere. But this is an entirely new internet. For decades we’ve assumed that online items were less valuable than physical ones, and internet participation was more about connecting the physical to the digital and managing your physical life online. With NFTs, that responsibility has changed. Not only has the digital world been completely untethered from the physical world, but we are now able to actually LIVE online. America online is now online America. And this change is significant. \\n\\nThe America Online of Web3 would break down this new value in every single way. Similarly to how the Web2 conveniently showed “normies” the functions of a consumer internet, there needs to be coordinated efforts to unveil the utility of the next internet. Note that it won’t be the decentralized, chaotic, high-risk but high-fun world of the current crypto-verse. It would only feature collections that the service considered reasonably priced and scam-free. It might even provide unhappy buyers with money-back guarantees! \\n\\nThe team behind such an effort would be relentlessly attacked by the crypto community as security risks and ‘centralizers’ -- both of which might actually be true -- even more than Steve Case, Jan Brandt and Ted Leonsis once were. And the hyper-rapid development cycles and attention deficit tendencies of crypto makes it difficult to create something integrated and comprehensive which doesn’t feel anachronistic by the time it launches. We’ll probably see elements of the concept in bits and pieces, perhaps from mega-platforms like Facebook, Amazon and Apple, rather than as a standalone single offering. And it’s possible that the success of such a platform would be short-lived anyway, like the bicycle training wheels a kid finds cumbersome, even embarrassing, within a few months.\\n\\nBut the need right now is real. Is there any path to rapid scale? Is there an analogy to the tidal wave of 3.5-inch floppies that found every tech-laggard in America and got them an email address? Is anyone thinking big enough? We believe we should try.\\n\\n \\n  \\n \",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"XdzGaKgCMXmm7Xgaai_u4-iv7MCjF025sip_TJSDrVo\",\"timestamp\":1636395377,\"title\":\"America Onchain: \\\"You've Got Scale?\\\"\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\"}],\"editions\":[]},\"ProjectType:0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\",\"address\":\"0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a50b6785-1a70-493e-9803-052c753b5337.jpeg?height=1041\\u0026width=1040\",\"description\":\"Non-Fungible Incentives For Open Innovation\",\"displayName\":\"Planck Manuscripts\",\"domain\":\"s.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"p1anck.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"ORANGE\",\"colorMode\":\"LIGHT\"}},\"ProjectType:0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\",\"address\":\"0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee6df49e-7d8a-4530-8397-a87d062c8ae9.png?height=250\\u0026width=250\",\"description\":\"Weekly musings on web3\",\"displayName\":\"Jamm Session\",\"domain\":\"jammsession.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"flynnjamm.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"BLUE\",\"colorMode\":\"DARK\"}},\"ProjectType:0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\",\"address\":\"0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\",\"avatarURL\":null,\"description\":null,\"displayName\":\"Tal\",\"domain\":null,\"ens\":null,\"gaTrackingID\":null,\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":null},\"ProjectType:0xc8f8e2F59Dd95fF67c3d39109ecA2e2A017D4c8a\":{\"__typename\":\"ProjectType\",\"_id\":\"0xc8f8e2F59Dd95fF67c3d39109ecA2e2A017D4c8a\",\"address\":\"0xc8f8e2F59Dd95fF67c3d39109ecA2e2A017D4c8a\",\"avatarURL\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b512577a-2bd8-40ef-b7bc-2f3b139e1af0.png?height=1020\\u0026width=1020\",\"description\":\"\",\"displayName\":\"Visualize Value\",\"domain\":\"vv.mirror.xyz\",\"ens\":\"visualizevalue.eth\",\"gaTrackingID\":\"\",\"mailingListURL\":null,\"headerImage\":null,\"theme\":{\"__typename\":\"UserProfileThemeType\",\"accent\":\"FOREGROUND\",\"colorMode\":\"DARK\"}},\"entry:wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM\",\"body\":\"![by Javier Grixo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wHYtd75UhuVy9l1HlSKkt.jpg?height=3239\\u0026width=4858)\\n\\n\\u003e “When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” - Steve Jobs\\n\\nWe do these things…\\n\\n\\u003e “…not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” - John F. Kennedy\\n\\nLet’s begin with some facts.\\n\\n‘Centralization’ isn’t failing or fatally flawed. Centralized products and platforms are popular and successful. Centralization provides users with convenience, incredibly low prices, comprehensive directories and marketplaces, and just about everything else we associate with compelling innovations. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Apple, and Twitter are all examples of fantastically successful centralization that provides value every single day.\\n\\nBut centralization absolutely *does* limit the number of big ‘winners.’ The omnipresent power law skews value relentlessly to the top. We see this across top companies, investors, creators, influencers and beyond. The more centralized the platform or business, the more this tendency proves true.\\n\\nSo the real argument for crypto, and more broadly decentralization, is *not* that centralized systems are broken. Or that the current business models of the internet are not working. Because, in fact, they *are* for most consumers and many tens of thousands of creators. It’s that they are *so* functional that only a radical redistribution of control and ownership could wedge new opportunities to create more equity. It’s an attempt to counterbalance the massive ‘power law effects’ of these centralized systems.\\n\\nHere’s how it works, at least in theory:\\n\\n“Hey, Ms. or Mr. Developer or Creator or User, we are really worried about centralized systems. We’d like you to help us build alternatives. But we also know that you *not* using or working on those super-successful centralized things is a cost to you, and that developing these decentralized alternatives is going to be hard to pull off, so we’re going to make you an amazing once-in-a-lifetime offer. We will architect this whole new alternative system such that you will actually earn and/or buy inexpensive ‘shares’ and get a meaningful voice in what might just maybe be the next biggest thing. Maybe the biggest thing ever. And so, if and when all this does actually happen, you’ll be one of the big winners. We promise. And we don’t just *promise*. We’ll put it in a (smart) contract.”\\n\\nCrypto is a direct, maybe even desperate, financial and emotional appeal to shift your ass from passive consumption to active collaboration.\\n\\nNow, a gambit this great *only* makes sense if you believe in the massive self-perpetuating appeal of centralization. The competitive disadvantages of decentralization are so immense that it only works if the offered incentives (economic, cultural) outweigh those disadvantages. Which is why the incentives are a historically unprecedented amount of money and status. Think of it like the biggest XPRIZE in history, being offered to everyone on the planet.\\n\\nBut it should be noted, this incentive system *does* lead to a signaling problem. To keep people motivated to believe, work hard and spread these decentralized environments, it’s very helpful that the prices of the shares (ie., tokens, etc) and that triumphant vibe within the culture — all plausible evidence of the potential size of the prize and our progress towards it — continue to grow. And when we engineer the incentives correctly (tokenomics, ftw!), they do. The problem is that we have this natural mental association that assumes that when prices go up, when people get famous, and when huge sums of money are raised that means that the new thing is already working.\\n\\nBut in this case, that’s only partially true. It’s *true* that the incentive system is working, that people are flocking, that we’re getting artists and developers paid, that there’s a great feeling of community and commitment, and that there’s a growing awareness and interest from folks on the outside. But it’s not necessarily true that decentralized technology is working particularly well as a feasible replacement for those centralized competitors. At least not yet or any time soon. After all, as we know, the problem is incredibly hard. We wouldn’t be attacking centralization in this insane way if it wasn’t.\\n\\nAnd one of the specific consequences of the signaling problem is that it leads some people to underestimate the ability of the centralized systems to adjust. There's a natural assumption that successful systems get fat and lazy and that their processes become calcified and resistant to new information regarding threats. And after all, why would everything on the decentralized side be going up in value, if the competitor wasn't ripe for the killing?\\n\\nBut that assumption, that centralized systems don’t know what they’re doing, is delusional. These tech companies are fucking smart. They are led by nimble (and paranoid) leaders, with a ton of money and other treats to hand out, who have no problem understanding the importance of disrupting themselves (see Facebook). If their ‘number of winners’ problem gets too noticeable and acute, there’s a lot of tuning they can do, both symbolic and real, to adjust and make the situation look a lot better. And, here’s the kicker: it’s especially easy for them to co opt the user-friendliest features of decentralized culture to make themselves more popular. Not only that, but the incentive-seeking folks on the decentralized side will be overjoyed that they are being embraced by the big centralized companies (see Twitter verifying NFTs!). Because it increases the value of their ‘shares.’\\n\\nSo, given how daunting the challenge actually is, let’s ask ourselves again: Is centralization *really* as dangerous as those of us on the Web3 side believe? Does it lead inexorably to oligopoly, censorship, and the constraint of innovation? And if so, do those risks outweigh the difficulties and disadvantages posed by the blockchain gambit? On this, reasonable people can disagree.\\n\\nBut any reasonable person would also admit that the competent and popular centralization of our current moment puts massive, historic, practically God-like powers in the hands of a few dozen men (basically, all men) and a few thousand of their execs. That’s a few thousand ‘big winners’ among billions of people. They are for the most part not subject to boards or shareholders. While one or two may stumble, it's hardly far-fetched that the current pantheon will remain more or less unchanged for decades to come. Our devices will get cheaper, our networks more powerful, and our online experiences more engrossing. The number of lives influenced by this small group will continue to increase. So will the power and subtlety of their influence.\\n\\nAnd any reasonable person would again agree that it is not some panicky conjecture that these few leaders will acquiesce to, even collaborate with, authoritarian governments and anti-democratic movements when they think it unavoidable, when it protects or extends their corporate power. Despite how rich all these folks already are, this is happening today, as a matter of normal business. If the realistic prospect of a technology like the Metaverse, deployed in partnership with dictators and demagogues doesn’t qualify as a danger, then there’s probably not much that concerns you.\\n\\nWill the ‘Hail Mary’ of crypto, with all of its chaos and con jobs, do a better job with these threats? Come on. Nobody knows. As much as the wild incentive system doesn’t necessarily mean it will work, it’s equally wrong to say that it *can’t*. The underlying structure of the Internet is decentralized. Open Source projects are decentralized. They work. But they also imperfect, and have left massive openings for centralized systems to address their gaps and limitations.\\n\\nBased on everything we know, the most likely outcome is one of partial success. Some additional and important functions of the communications, media and financial system will be taken over by reasonably decentralized protocols and governance. This will be accompanied by the spread of platforms that enable groups of creators and inventors to fund their growth without as much dependency on the centralized networks. And this will lead some of the centralized systems to adopt and co-opt the features and culture of the blockchain which in turn creates new opportunities and openings. A different group of people, hopefully many more of them, hopefully not mostly men or Western, and with different (perhaps not objectively better but fresh) aspirations, ascend to the echelons of hyper-influence. In other words, a somewhat more dynamic and democratic system.\\n\\nWe think it’s worth trying.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"wZNuGlgm-DTui3U4gM9T6jUWXQ2XX2bxMRABG5v0SPM\",\"timestamp\":1633346995,\"title\":\"Web3's

are entering the age of living online**. An increasing number of people have employment that exists only online. We have meaningful relationships that are primarily or even only online. It should not be surprising that a growing number of us -- especially we who are most intensely online -- are embracing the concept of ‘owning’ online things. A belief in the value of NFTs is a logical extension of the vitality of online experience and existence. \\n\\nAs with the ‘real world,’ the things we own enable important connections to other people. If we own related things, we may share similar personalities, interests or life situations. We may have a common vested interest in preserving or increasing their ongoing value. We may also be engaged in a kind of game with each other, competing to purchase more or more special versions of the item. We are bound together by economic commitments. \\n\\nThe archetypal example in the physical world is real estate. Where we live is a huge part of our identity and, usually, our net worth. By owning property in the same neighborhood, we have committed, at least to some extent, to a shared destiny. When we volunteer, for example, for an event or organization that makes the block a nicer place to live, when we organize or sponsor services that enrich the area, it enhances the value of everyone’s home. As the value of the neighborhood increases, we benefit together, both in terms of status as well as financially. As our relationships and sense of self become more embedded in the neighborhood, we become more attached to the property, deepening the connection and spurring active engagement. In healthy neighborhoods, all residents benefit from this ‘virtuous circle.’ Ownership leads to meaningful engagement which leads to increased desirability.. \\n\\nNFT collections, and especially the latest wave of ‘avatar communities’ aka PFP collections, have the potential to mirror this healthy dynamic. When we own a SupDuck or Cryptoad, we have a motivation to engage in behavior that makes everyone’s ownership more significant. As ‘residents’ of that virtual neighborhood, we all have an interest in broadening the list of ‘stuff you get’ as part of your NFT. And yet, the vast majority of these projects pay only lip service to that potential. The vast majority of projects offer only hand-waving assurances of future amenities. Rather than investing in genuinely valuable services for its community, the focus tends rather to be on shilling and stunts to generate FOMO. \\n\\nLet’s take a stroll down memory lane. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the mortgage bubble made home ownership more affordable. Builders responded by investing a lot of money to purchase land in areas that allowed for mass development of residential neighborhoods. There was so much money that developers built entire neighborhoods in the middle of nowhere with hopes of driving individual interest and eventual communities. Twenty five years later, some people still live there, some projects are completely torn down and one thing is for certain; none of them were built to last. These homes weren’t built in places that were convenient or around major metropolitan cities or downtowns driven by existing communities and culture, they were built where land was cheap. But people were like whatever. And eventually there was a huge market flippening in these spaces. \\n\\nMost of today’s Web3 virtual neighborhoods are following the history of the physical world’s McMansions; building 10,000 ‘homes’ in the middle of nowhere hoping people move in. The awareness that needs to take place in order to avoid a mass flippening is the approach Web3 takes to constructing neighborhoods. Instead of just finding land, developing homes and hoping community fosters through a shared space, developers need to invest in making sure individual buyers get value out of their experience. This means making sure that every single day, there is something happening in the community. NFTs communities can be awesome, we just need to start building shit inside of them. \\n\\n## A community first approach to neighborhoods. \\n\\nIn order for virtual neighborhoods to be long lasting, attention needs to move from owning space and land to developing robust services  within the areas where people live. If NFTs get you into the club, what happens once you’re in it? One likely way this question will be answered is to focus the collection community on a particular shared interest. When members share values, it becomes vastly easier to determine and develop the benefits that they will consider valuable. \\n\\nWhat sort of shared interests might be well-suited to token-communities? Unlike Web media, NFT communities are participatory environments. It’s not about passively consuming but actively participating with the content and community directly. Content takes on an entirely new role of creating virtual space, like physical space is a venue for cooperation and collaboration. So they can be smaller in total audience size than those required to support an ad-based business, provided the members’ commitment is sufficiently intense. So there’s no shortage of potential interests that might be addressed. \\n\\nCommunities can be built around professional networks, for example. Picture an NFT collection celebrating and welcoming designers or teachers or security experts. Another possible focus could be causes, like the climate crisis or free speech. We might also see cohesive communities around hobbies (fashion! surfing! hunting!) or fitness/wellness activities (crossfit! fasting! meditation!) \\n\\nBut we need to be realistic about the effort needed to create compelling experiences with these ‘neighborhoods.’.  Web3 communities need programming. In an era where NFT drops serve as a catalyst for community building, there is a tendency to hope that  individuals will  build the culture and activities of their collection This does happen but is probably insufficient for lasting value. The reason why traditional media has done a good job for decades of readership is that there is a content cadence that drives discussion, consumption and community engagement. But the real opportunity for Web3 to break out is the reverse incentive of the contribution of work. Today’s creators deal with a sort of volunteerism where the small percentage of individuals who do break through actually make money. Authenticity is lost in exchange for trying to grasp an audience, and free labor often results in… free content. But looking outside of the media to build Web3 communities is a catalyst for innovation, where content becomes the space for activities, participation and relationships. For example, in the physical world, SoulCycle has built an entire culture around physically working out but then digitally learning how to eat better and meet like minded individuals who want to live a similar lifestyle. Individuals reside in these “neighborhoods” because there is constant programming to keep them engaged and incentives to build the community up to better themselves and those around them. Purpose is driven through the development of content, and Web3 communities must proactively work to make the places where people reside a daily habit. It is important to invest in the ability for individuals to get value out of their experience, that every single day there is something happening. \\n\\nGood things cost money, and you can’t get valuable experiences without investing in the community to build them. A worthy investment for NFT projects is around education. A key value of communities and neighborhoods is that individuals are able to teach one another. We are starting to see this foster in Web3 through community driven discords, telegrams and WhatsApps but oftentimes, this is happening outside of the project owners themselves. Arguably, this is a feature not a bug as the community is free to build on top of the IP distributed by the origin creators but as we think about lasting value, there needs to be an incentive to cultivate contribution through shared learning from one another. This means that it should be instilled at a foundational level that then bubbles up through the community regardless of which platforms they are spending time with one another one. \\n\\n## Putting interests at the forefront of infrastructure. \\n\\nToday’s Web3 neighborhoods are mostly being built around financial interests. And the promise of getting rich does lure people to these neighborhoods---the 10,000 houses may well be occupied, at least for a while. But we’ve seen this play out IRL, with gold-rush Boomtowns from the 1800s becoming today’s Ghost Towns, having failed to attract real residents and establish a culture. Visit one of these places today and you’ll see they didn’t get much built beyond a saloon, a place to meet up and talk about finding gold. Visit the discord of a forgotten PFP project from July and you’ll see something similar--a now abandoned general chat, containing little but a discussion of prices and sales. \\\\n  \\\\n But there were exceptions--- some Boomtowns attracted families and developed a thriving culture, becoming San Francisco, Chicago, Denver. The great HBO show Deadwood is the story of how a historical Boomtown developed a culture and transcended the speculative interests that drew people to it in the first place. Its creator David Milch felt that a true society often starts with a “symbol agreed upon”. For Milch this can be a cross, but it can also be gold (or perhaps even drawings of apes.) And it’s that agreement that liberates individuals to participate and find their “identity in the collective.” For Milch, you can start with speculation but you can’t stop there. \\n\\nDeadwood posits that if a lasting culture is to form, it will be aided by spaces, artifacts, rituals, and symbols. And with NFTs and DAOs we might be seeing the emergence of the digitally native forms of these essential human primitives. But it’s up to these nascent Boomtowns to use them, with success being observed with the deepening the group’s interactions and the expansion of their interests and reach. Certainly beyond the narrow motives that drew people to them in the first place, but beyond crypto as well. \\n\\nOn the flipside, building for interest groups has its challenges that will need to be met. By building neighborhoods around a particular interest, we are deliberately constraining the market size which will slow down value and decrease speculation. It becomes a stabler, yet less exciting investment. Why it’s critical to incorporate both financial and societal interests to maintain the right balance.\\n\\nNew communities are emerging on the internet by way of NFTs, giving individuals an opportunity to stake land and foster community in designated spaces constructed through residential avatars. But the approach of building communities this way is fragile. With unlimited space online and a gold rush to occupy mass areas, builders are overlooking the need for community in exchange for ownership. And that method, while momentarily successful when individuals have money to spend, deconstructs in the long run. \\n\\nNFT communities today are rewarding individuals for buying land and naming the sub-development versus what should be the true promise of crypto which is rewarding individuals that make the neighborhood flourish. It’s not the local mortgage services or banks that make a strong community, it’s the artists, restaurants and families that do. Today’s Web3 communities are building neighborhoods to attract community versus building communities to foster neighborhoods. This needs to change. \\n\\n** \\\\n  \\\\n

Century, media became an industrial product. This process had started with print, initially in the United Kingdom, and led to the massive successes of the newspaper and publishing industries. This same approach was applied to film, leading to the Hollywood studio system, which consciously employed the same production line framework as Ford's Detroit plants. So too did music become a production-oriented industry. Tin Pan Alley and the famous Brill Building were factories of culture, churning out songs, which would be paired with artists, recorded and pressed for distribution.\\n\\nThe heart of this transformation was the realization that there were economies of scale that, especially when coupled with the protections of copyright, could generate attractive profits for shareholders. The media company would have knowledge of its customer, through the new science of market research. This insight would be used to develop products that the market would desire. The products would be produced as efficiently as possible, pushing talent to create new work on budget and schedule.\\n\\nUsing the growing power of the media and its advertising complement, marketing departments would endeavor to turn products into hits, and hits into sequels, series and ongoing successes. The experience was delivered and defined by the industries directly, with a clear line of responsibilities-- and influence -- flowing from the creators to consumers. This taxonomy of roles gave a lot of power to the producers, who monopolized both development and delivery of goods across all industries.\\n\\nThen came the Internet, and the first casualty of industrial-era media was the same sector that started it: *newspapers*. Newspapers got unbundled, which deconstructed their core business units and then remixing began. But instead of newspapers reintegrating the value into their business, challengers emerged by way of social networks and reintegrated an environment that spun away from industrial control, built on community created content. \\n\\n\\u003e This provided the blueprint of remixed culture; industry bundles, unbundled by business, remixed by community and reintegrated into new mediums of exchange.\\n\\nBut let’s bring it back one time.\\n\\nOver the centuries of its steady growth, publishing had realized the way to maximize revenues was to include as much as possible within its ‘package.’ For ad-based titles, that meant bundling in as much advertising of as many kinds as possible: display, coupons, fliers, classifieds. That’s how we got editions of Vogue that weighed over five pounds and runs of the Sunday New York Times with so many inserts it needed to be wrapped in plastic. But publishing on the Web made it possible to ignore all that paid content. A reader could come to a story through a link and, apart from a few banners, never even encounter the classifieds. Worse, other pureplay startups were actually better at rebundling in advertising than the publishers.\\n\\n*Music was next.*\\n\\nThe seeds were planted in the mid-1960s with the creation of the Long Play (LP). With this new technology, artists suddenly had a much broader canvas on which they could ‘paint’ their musical ideas. The most ambitious acts realized the potential and almost overnight transformed the purpose of pop. And the labels, after years of focusing almost exclusively on the single, recognized this bigger bundle could make them a lot more money. By the end of the 1970s, however, the album was struggling. Under pressure to produce enough content to fill two long sides, the quality had crashed and newer genres (Disco, Punk, Hip-Hop) had gravitated back to shorter formats. A cash cow was in jeopardy. The answer? CDs. For a while it worked very very well. The new bundle was less expensive to make but the labels were able to charge more for it. People even bought CDs to replace their vinyl favorites. Happy days, for the industry, were here again.\\n\\n*But then came file-sharing.* \\n\\nMusic fans had been ‘stealing’ and sharing music, of course, since the creation of the Philips home cassette recorder in the 1960s. Entire cultures, like Deadheads, grew up around the swapping of prized recordings. Mixtape making became a passion for millions of fans. But it had never been a threat to the industry before. By 2001, the ever-increasing cost of CDs, the low killer/filler ratio of the bundle, and the superpowers of the Internet coincided to create the perfect storm. \\n\\nSuperfans took desires into their own hands. If they weren’t able to buy and trade music the way they wanted, they were going to take control of both the pricing and experience. This revolution changed the fan and artist relationship as we knew it, forcing an industry stuck on its laurels and business models into the internet age. It was chaotic, near fatal, and left much of the businesses history up to that point in its wake. But it forced an entirely new business around relationships and IP and evolved to a model that was a creative unlock for fans, labels and artists alike leading to an eventual restabilization. \\n\\nNapster was just an early first step in the move towards the new creator to fan model but it was the moment where the industry admitted that the audience is ultimately in control. IP could be adjusted, manipulated and remixed. It ushered in a new age.\\n\\nAcross media, this technologically mediated process has led to the unbundling, rebundling, remixing and then reintegration of content and IP. Traditionally, IP has been a one way process; a creator of IP licenses to another party and it goes down the assembly line. But thanks to technology that’s changed. Today media is increasingly dominated by decentralized IP that takes a different approach, one that presents a multi-directional relationship between fan and creator. And when we talk about remixing, it’s not just about re-imagining third-party material. It’s about creating entirely new work. \\n\\n***These Are The Good Times***\\n\\nThere’s no precise moment to mark the beginning of the remix era. But it’s important to recognize that one reason shorter form vinyl came back into popularity by the end of the 1970s was not only because the album had become a bloated mess of throwaway tracks; it was because club DJs had figured out how to take R\\u0026B songs and make them into something amazing. And they did it live. They played songs with great hooks, and to keep their audiences dancing and happy, figured out how to use the turntable to drop back and keep the party going. This wasn’t a new song exactly, but it was a longer version of it. \\n\\nPretty soon, labels who wanted their artists promoted in discos came out with special versions of songs with longer dance sections, or breakdowns. This led directly into the next innovation, the seamless merging of one song with the one that followed. The aim was to never let the dance floor get empty. So the best figured out how to time the transition just right such that it created one continuous flow of melody. There would be this wonderful moment at the merging point where the two songs played over each other, making something recognizable and yet novel. Rap emcees added one more layer on top, taking the Jamaican toasting style and James Brownian braggadociousness, now creating something lyrical and truly original. \\n\\nIt’s probably not an accident that the musical breakthrough of hip hop resembled the layered effect of New York graffiti, a palimpsest of different artists adding their own signature contributions. Not quite as criminal as tagging subway cars, but it existed outside the law. Not that anybody cared at first. The first recorded rap songs were cassettes sold on street corners and out of car trunks. But eventually their popularity was too big for the gray market and crews put out real records. And promptly got sued. Probably the most famous early example was ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ Layering their infectious phrases over a barely modified Nile Rodgers’ baseline, the Sugarhill Gang scored the first ever Billboard Hot 100 hip hop hit. Once Chic’s lawyers got involved, Nile and his partner Bernard Edwards were added as songwriters and the rest is musical history. Forty years later, hip hop is arguably the most popular genre in the world, and it’s all based on sampling. \\n\\n***On the Internet nobody knows you’re a blog***\\n\\nA similar remix process happened to news and written content more broadly. Now that newspapers and magazines had been unbundled on the Web, they, like singles in music, could be harvested for the creation of something new and created by end-users. \\n\\n‘User-created content,’ of course, is as old as the Internet, which was designed by and around research institutions with no inherent sense of professional versus amateur content. Anyone who had an account with access was a potential publisher. Creators took advantage of the freedom of the early Internet to write and share content on subjects they loved. Usenet and Gopher directories were bursting with original commentary and reviews of favorite shows and books, like Lord of the Rings, Dune and Star Trek. And the most original aspect of this geek creativity was fanfic, unauthorized new stories featuring beloved characters, often in transgressive romantic situations. \\n\\nThen came the Web, and for a while, the graphical/visual flavor of this new UX helped reassert the dominance of professional publishers. In the late 90s, every newspaper rushed to build websites and make distribution deals. Offline titles with their logos and photos, organized into the channels of ‘portals,’ all festooned with branded banners, seemed like a new normal. User-creators were herded into message boards, chat rooms and community features, below the fold, away from the ads. The professional content was the star of the show.\\n\\nBut it didn’t last long. The bubble popped, the portals crashed and the bottom-up energy of the Usenet came roaring back under the rubric of Web 2.0. It was a whole constellation of new technologies and ideologies but they crystallized in the concept of the weblog. \\n\\nBlogs began as a kind of online public diary — hence the name — but fairly soon, the most common purpose was public commentary, typically written around quotes from and links to news articles. Some blogs, like the Drudge Report, were like alternative versions of a newspaper front page, with the blogger playing the role of the front page editor, picking the most important stories from across the Web and rewriting the headlines. Others blogs would take one news article and deconstruct it, annotating and criticizing. All this was made possible, needless to say, because all those professional publishers had unbundled their content, at that time rarely behind subscription walls or even registration, directly on the Web. There was free and easy access to the underlying raw material. Blogs were remixing it and each other with captivating results. \\n\\nWe all know what happened next. The open APIs and protocols of blogging were swallowed up by the increasingly closed but increasingly viral feeds of social networks. Entirely new forms of visual communication, memes, with unique styles of humor and patterns of layered remixing, thrived, reaching millions within minutes, driving ‘engagement.’ What had been unbundled and remixed had suddenly become bundled again. Inside these massive algorithmic systems, creators were more powerful than ever and yet curiously also powerless. Publishers faced the same sort of dilemma. Without the amplification of the remixing influencers (as they came to be called), the media companies got no amplification. But all the unbundled content they pumped in only made the social networks stronger. We’ve been dealing with the consequences and ramifications on our cultural, political and social lives ever since. And it’s only accelerating. \\n\\n***The TikTokification of IP***\\n\\nSimilar to the music business in the hip hop era, it’s increasingly hard for today’s media companies to absolutely prevent developers, creators, fans and consumers from building on top of their IP. This is not new, and anyone walking through Times Square in Manhattan knows that Bumblebee or The Minions will work tirelessly to latch on to you, grab a selfie and chase you down for $10. More broadly, major media hits have long been remixed versions of existing IP. This has been happening in the games industry for decades where every major hit, from Counterstrike, to Fortnite, to League of Legends has been a user generated mod of an existing popular game and IP. But while it isn’t new, the pace of remixing is increasing, and the practical control IP owners have over their works is slipping and the social acceptance and in fact critical importance of remixing is only rising exponentially. \\n\\nLook no further than the rise of Tiktok. TikTok is the most important social network today for shaping culture and it is largely powered by a mass market remixing system unlike any we’ve ever had. In many respects, TikTok is the inevitable and natural conclusion of the memfication and socialization of content. If the medium is the message, then IP is the ink with which it's written. Users react, recreate, remix and redefine any and all IP in a massive algorithmically driven social experiment designed to take existing ideas, content, and formats, mash them together perhaps with a bit of something new, throw them at the wall, and see what sticks, only to scrape up what does and start the whole process over again.\\n\\nOf course the tiktokification of IP is happening everywhere. Its happening on Roblox with respect to games and virtual experiences, its happening on soundcloud with respect to music, its happening on Wattpad with respect to text. The catalyst for an industry to move from one-way to two-way IP relationships is the emergence of tooling that lowers the barrier of entry to engage with the IP itself. Like the shift from newspapers to social networks, today’s IP is evolving from community engagement and consumption to community creation and development. \\n\\n***A generation of reintegration***\\n\\nOne important way this is likely to happen now is NFTs. Over the next several years, it’s probable that every media company who owns popular characters, worlds and brands is going to enable users to collect these individual unbundled assets by owning them as tokens. The driving motivation for these IP businesses is not a preference for unbundling, of course. Like every other profit-maximizing organization, they understand the value of forcing customers to buy a larger package. But creative companies are operating within a media landscape that is dominated by a small number of even bigger bundlers, the social networks, streaming platforms and app stores. On all sides, opportunities for direct relationships with and uncapped revenue from end-users are drying up. In this context, the possibilities offered by NFTs are tantalizing: a near zero-cost product that can be sold and re-sold, perhaps for a considerable amount, without any disintermediation. And on the surface, it’s a model that looks almost exactly like merchandising, a business they know well.\\n\\nBut, as we’ve seen over and over again, regardless of why unbundling occurs, whether because consumers force it or producers embrace it (and it’s usually a combination), one result will always be remixing. When the atom of IP gets smaller and easier to handle, creative recombination -- a new molecule! -- becomes inevitable. And NFTs, like all blockchain elements and assets, are designed to be combined. So we’re heading towards another perfect storm: unbundled popular IP, issues as composable media ‘legos,’ in the hands of millions of creative people armed with powerful computers (phones) and distribution.\\n\\nLike other remix moments, IP owners will be faced with a challenge. Their cultural tendencies are still rooted in the industrial past. Their strong preference is to control the entire process, from idea to franchise. Indeed, many of the media forms which generate the greatest profits (movies, video games and theme parks) require years of careful planning and control. Despite everything they’ve seen over the past 50 years, IP owners are unprepared. Some will sue. They will add scary terms (‘copyfright’) to the sales of their NFTs and send out cease-and-desist letters, especially when the new combinations start making money for their creators. Some will be tolerant, watching quietly from the sidelines, perhaps fearful of fan backlash. Still others will be excited cheerleaders, tweeting out cool and amusing examples of their stuff remixed. \\n\\nThe greatest opportunity is one big step beyond any of these tactics: **reintegration**. The logical end to industrial media, the creative mode finally enabled by the blockchain, is a dynamic system where the remix continuously flows back into the source material. Is this practically possible? Could there ever be a version of the Star Wars Universe, for example, where stories or games that were created by fans, depicted or played using NFTs, were embraced and included within the canon? How would decisions of what to include be made, and by whom? And perhaps most importantly, could the creators of these remixes be rewarded for their contributions? \\n\\nThe winners of the next media era will have answers to these questions. \\n\\n***So where does that leave IP?***\\n\\nAs platforms emerge to enable creators to better construct, remix and monetize new IP, brands and creators need to make a decision as to whether to give access to creative development or to make creative development “hackable”. In the case of Napster, the industry overlooked the power of digital and instead of structuring a business in the internet age, fans hacked the early prototypes that would be consumer downloads and streaming for the music business to then take and build sophistication onto afterwards. In the case of TikTok, these tools are provided as part of the platform; consumers are creators and are encouraged to compound value on top of each other’s IP in order to make it more engaging, more participatory. This is increasingly the same for gaming and other industries that have recognized the value of removing the barriers of fan and creator and seeing the value of encouraging others to build on top of their IP. \\n\\nThe larger question about NFTs and media is how they will inevitably be used by ‘collectors’ to make new versions of storyworlds, a process which then presents the IP owner with the problem of how to consider those new creations. Should they be ignored? Tolerated? Or celebrated and integrated? It’s a challenge that is not going away. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2e26334e-b039-40e6-a225-571d57b9d9fa.png?height=607\\u0026width=587)\\n\\nThe process of bundle, unbundle, remix, reintegration isn’t linear. The disruption of industrial models doesn’t completely leave the existing platforms, creators and IP in its wake, it just moves them to either adjust or forfeit existing control. If we are moving towards a more accelerated remix culture, IP owners will need to decide whether to cede ground to fans, community members and other artists or adjust their existing value proposition. The tension is already there.\\n\\nMaybe the next generation of media mindset is being able to bring together all of this creativity and move it towards something? Or rethinking the way franchises develop and bridge relationships with fans in the forms of DAOs or other participation structures? Maybe the more things change the more they stay the same?\\n\\nThere are many questions. But here’s what we do know. IP is moving from one way to two way creation and consumption. Technology is making every content format developable and by making a genre \\\"developable\\\", it supercharges the two way IP model. When access becomes available to more than just experts, it starts to make the consumer more important than the creator and open season for remixing. As such franchises and content in general are already governed by fans, even if IP holders don't acknowledge it. \\n\\nTo be successful in this new world, IP holders will need to adjust and focus less on control and more on managing chaos. The new media model will employ a mindset of being able to take all of this creativity and move it towards something completely new, leveraging the systems and skills to listen, integrate, celebrate and put periphery into the center of its work. As remixing becomes increasingly accepted and encouraged as an art form, and product strategies congregate around platforms built for its reintegration, the decision to open up IP must be embraced by the creators themselves or it will be imposed by their audiences. The same way it always has been. \\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"seA6j67Jc0mm8vqGe1zTuXC7O0h95XlmazSQXDlrd24\",\"timestamp\":1626792662,\"title\":\"Hip Hop, Blogs and NFTs: Unbundling, Remixing and Reintegrating Media (NFT Drop)\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":204,\"featuredImage\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaAssetType\",\"mimetype\":\"image/png\",\"sizes\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaAssetSizesType\",\"og\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaAssetSizeType\",\"src\":\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/nft/047eb458-1332-448b-b3ff-bbc21b8579f0.png\",\"height\":2160,\"width\":4320}}},\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xc8f8e2F59Dd95fF67c3d39109ecA2e2A017D4c8a\"}],\"editions\":[{\"__ref\":\"edition:0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E-46\"},{\"__ref\":\"edition:0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E-47\"},{\"__ref\":\"edition:0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E-48\"}]},\"entry:aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\",\"body\":\"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19582697-172f-42a6-9955-769c2d6d8b2b.jpeg?height=900\\u0026width=1600)\\n\\nImplicit in the name ‘Web3’ is the expectation of replacement. In technology, versions are successors. When the new model comes out, we upgrade and the older one is replaced and forgotten.\\n\\nIs this what we mean when we refer to Web3? Will it replace the set of principles, technologies and behaviors that we’ve come to know as Web2? (Is this even the way that phases of the Internet works?)  \\n\\nMany blockchain enthusiasts seem to suggest as much. As the term Web2 has become closely associated with centralized social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and as those networks have become increasingly politically powerful -- with arbitrary, capricious or simply incompetent moderation policies not to mention potentially societally harmful business practices -- it is common to hear crypto folks imply that decentralized applications would do a better job. Community-owned networks would be fairer, in that the users who created the content and attracted new members would fully participate, as token holders, in the value they created. The distribution of content could be based on meaningful values like reputation and expertise, rather than gamified outrage and algorithmically rewarded hype. And governance, like moderation policies, would be driven by the entire community, rather than a small club of executives and their handpicked oversight committees made up of insiders looking to maximize their own wealth or security. The attractiveness of this superior model, it is proposed, will lure in key influencers, provide a better user experience, and propel a shift from the old social platforms to the new.\\n\\nAnd yet, it’s difficult to see how that happens. If anything, it seems like crypto has made the ‘old’ centralized social networks, especially Twitter, more central than ever. How many influencers have used their followers to make an easy leap into crypto sales? How many important projects have used social media to find and recruit contributors? Where else would advocates for new coins and tokens state their cases and share their memes? Where else could we show off our CryptoPunks, Hashmasks and Bored Apes? And how could a Bitcoin day trader not keep his eyes glued on Elon’s Twitter feed over the past few months? Social media is so essential to the day-to-day reality of DeFi that it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins. And it is arguably precisely the gamified virality of centralized platforms that makes them so valuable to crypto marketing and community. \\n\\nGiven this dynamic, how realistic is some transition? Or have we actually trapped ourselves deeper in a centralized system? And what is actually wrong with Web2 anyway?\\n\\n### What is actually wrong with Web2?\\n\\nIn 2004 “Web2” was popularized at a conference which sought to ask the very same question: “What is wrong?” The organizers of the first Web2 conference felt that the industry “had lost its way” after the dotcom bubble burst and needed an injection of confidence. In particular, there was a sense that the vertically integrated portals, like America Online and Yahoo, had created unsustainable monoliths ‘evilly’ trapped users and their data, prevented creative innovation from smaller startups, and led to bubble and bust. Web2 at its outset was about understanding and emulating the ideals and design concepts of the open source movement, but also the success of companies that were still expanding despite the drought, like Google and Amazon. \\n\\nIn those days, Google especially was seen as a role model, in the way that it sent searching users away to the best resources. Rather than try to seize 100% of the value, the virtuous approach was also the best for the ecosystem. The symbolically central concept was that of the ‘open API.’ Everyone should and would build on everyone else. In fact, one of the most important lessons gleaned from the surviving companies was that user-generated content and data could be a source of sustainable competitive advantage while improving the user experience and the web for all. Users would from here on be first-class contributors, no longer relegated to bottom-of-the-page comments sections, but rather the stars of these new open systems. Developers would vie to attract their usage and contributions by offering ever greater freedoms and flexibility. The best companies would be the best platforms, creating more value for the entire ecosystem.\\n\\nBut the catch was that this was never a sustainable long-term strategy, at least not for the purposes of promoting an open ecosystem. User-generated data is vulnerable to a family of sub optimizations such as Goodhart’s Law, in which using a “measure” as a “metric” devalues the measure itself. If you’re Google building PageRank on natural weblinks you’ll quickly generate SEO schemes which seek to game your measure. If you’re Amazon relying on user-generated reviews, you’ll soon be flooded with fakes. And if you’re Facebook building algorithms for user recommendation, you’ll soon be suggested content in your existing ideologies and filter bubbles. \\n\\nThese measure-based competitive advantages erode as companies instill them as metrics to be gained and optimized against. The result is that these companies, naturally seeking to maintain advantage, are forced to develop strong capabilities in user management and manipulation themselves. More charitably, it turns out that the data was more a means to reduce friction, improve experience and aggregate demand centrally, recreating most of the negatives of the old portal system, just with a friendly moniker that everything is just one click away. These successful companies in most cases weren’t true platforms, but aggregators, locking in demand and exerting central control, though admittedly with a velvet fist enforced at least at first and in part by superior user experience.\\n\\nAnd this necessary lock-in is arguably the source of today’s ire. Whereas 2004's Web2 was reckoning with *marketplace failure*, 2021's Web3 is reckoning with *user failure*. We are a community of people failing the marshmallow test, always optimizing for less friction, more dopamine and shorter feedback cycles. We claim to want richer experiences, to support independent actors, to despise centralization and to demand more meaningful connections and higher quality content. But then we unlock our phones. And so Google, Facebook and Twitter’s success with data-based ad monetization and engagement optimized user experience is now the problem, not the solution. \\n\\nAs Web2 companies began to deeply understand the powerful potential of their innovations — the game-ish reaction buttons, the follower graph, the algorithmic ‘newsfeed’ — they became adept at a clever stratagem. Rather than committing to perpetual openness, they could offer new user tools or developer APIs and encourage the community to use them to create. If the results were beneficial to the company, they might allow this creativity to flourish for a while, but soon enough, they would either charge the most successful creations for prominence or buy or build their own. \\n\\nIt was hard to blame them for this approach. It worked! Twitter, Facebook and Google were for-profit companies and the dynamic was not new for ‘platforms.’ Microsoft, the boogeyman of the open source community, had employed similar tactics in its heyday. But it was the development and explosive growth of the smartphone that made it so ferocious. \\nMobile devices, with their app stores, emojis, cameras, notifications and most importantly, constant tactile presence, were the perfect match for ‘Web2’ social networks. Every new phone buyer was a potential heavy social user, and the dense relationship networks that quickly formed made it almost impossible for people to resist buying phones to access them. \\n\\nThis loop triggered a flood of new and highly engaged users unlike anything seen in the history of technology adoption. All over the world, people who recently had only limited access to computers were now checking their newsfeeds throughout the day. Every new family or friend each of them followed increased the value of the experience, the depth of their connection and the virality of the network. Mobile and social became a second brain, “notifications” a sixth sense. So, even if content creators and app developers knew the ‘game’ was ‘rigged,’ how could they not take advantage of this massive opportunity? Maybe, they reasoned, if their brand or invention was the first, if it was the best, it might be one of the few that got so big so fast they’d achieve some kind of escape velocity from the gravity well of the social networks. After all, it had happened. Social apps or content with just the right combination of uniqueness, design genius and luck had hit the jackpot and acquired millions of customers within hours. And so they poured their ideas, talent and cash into these platforms, adding even more appealing media and interactivity, fostering even deeper engagement without any additional cost to the network. And despite the grumbles about unfair practices or addictive behaviors, all this just made the networks more essential. The flood of users kept pouring in. \\n\\nWe now live in a world of this flood. It’s a world overflowing with social activity, a world where every institution is dragged around by the currents of a new wildly unpredictable environment. Our children dream of growing up to be Instagram ‘influencers.’ Our pop charts are a direct output of the most popular backing tracks on Tiktok. A Facebook-inspired political cult attacked the US Capitol. Even the social platforms are buffeted by the storms unleashed by their technology. Their efforts to assert control have little effect, other than making their position even more essential and central. So, it is in the context of this flooded world, that the notion of Web3 as a successor paradigm has such alluring appeal. \\n\\n- **Platform wealth and economic sharing**: Today, creators \\u0026 consumers contribute to a platform to gain social or economic status. But this status is rented (status on platform only, revenue shared directly with platform). In Web3 this status is owned. Not only is social reputation portable, but the relationship with IP created on platform can be owned and portable as well. \\n\\n- **Content ownership and rights**: Web3 introduces ownership as a process. As IP is put out on the web, IP is minted on chain in order to show provenance and give creator control to its distribution and usage rights. This is done on the individual level vs. the platform level. \\n\\n- **The happy accident of NFTs**: it seems increasingly evident that certain objects on an open, interoperable world computer will be treated and valued like, well… real objects. This is not yet fully understood, but insofar as NFTs are unique to blockchain-style architectures this would represent quite an advantage.\\n\\n- **Lies, hype and bots**: Actors can still choose to create as many personalities, handles, keys, etc. as they’d like. However, the incentive for building reputation is to accumulate as much good faith on a single identity as possible. This will enable better positioning and recruiting into more lucrative and socially beneficial opportunities than those handles that lack reputation. \\n\\n- **Governance, individual influence and moderation**: As we discussed in previous articles, ownership is less about financial upside and more about social influence. In Web3, the individual is now influential within the organization it holds tokens of, giving s/he the ability to drive decision making that will bring better health and effectiveness to the community. \\n\\n- **Permissionless development and composability**: Today’s platforms control what can and cannot be published on their network. It also starts every user from the same starting line. In Web3, development is unrestricted because the permission is tied directly to that individual's reputation. Every decision they make is tied to their identity, so it’s a choice as to whether or not you want to carry these decisions with you throughout the web. Everything built on the protocol is foundational to what others can build on top of it. So instead of everyone acting independently and starting from scratch, everyone works in collaboration and builds on top of foundational legos from other members before them. \\n\\n- **New models of work and collaboration**: The business models of Web3 encourage collaboration. In Web2, all revenue streams reward the action of the output (advertising against what’s already published, subscribing to a finished piece of work). In Web3, there’s now a business model on the input. Crowdfunding and social tokens are an investment in the idea before there is any output generated, encouraging strong collaboration at the onset which rewards all participants throughout the creative process\\n\\nThis is a rich set of imagined capabilities that directly answers the most pernicious problems of Web2 as it has crystallized nearly twenty years after its inception: ownership, governance, openness, incentives, reputation. In many ways, the solutions Web3 proposes are the direct opposite of those offered by social networks, a far ‘better deal’ for users, creators and developers, an approach intentionally weighted to reward the individual or team on the basis of her, his or their input, rather than be drowned amid ever increasing control and returns to the owners and operators of networks. Which leads us to the question: If it’s better for more people, will Web3 replace Web2? Why wouldn’t it? \\n\\nThere are three possible answers:\\n\\n1) No -- Web3 is best understood as a sort of ‘economic’ extension of Web2, especially of social media, and it will grow as Web2 grows.\\n\\n2) Sort of -- key aspects of Web2 will be better performed by Web3 systems and there will be a symbiotic relationship between two parallel but similarly powerful models.\\n\\n3) Yes -- over time, all of the key aspects of Web2, including centralized social networks, will be replaced by web3-style user-owned and governed protocols.\\n\\nWe can think of these being three horizons: Web3 as testing ground (1), as complement (2), or as critique (3). As for the first, it may be that Web3 is a sort of open lab of experimentation whose successes will eventually be absorbed by existing structures. This testing ground outcome emerges if the natural inefficiencies of, say, Web3 database structures don’t have any compensating advantages over the long term. The second outcome of complementarity occurs as aspects of Web3 thrive alongside, and even enhance the value of, Web2. This seems to be the case with Twitter, which may be the greatest consumer onramp to Web3 and clearly plays a major role in the ecosystem. The third outcome, the most extreme, is probably best thought of as Web3 being an inherent critique of Web2. Replacement will seem necessary insofar as Twitter, or Facebook, or Paypal’s success is thought to be Web3’s failure. \\n\\nPerhaps one difference between today’s context and 2004’s -- when we roughly transitioned to the social/mobile Web2 -- is that the large tech companies that have mastered their strategies are broadly and firmly entrenched, and it isn’t as clear how a newcomer can emulate or even improve on their strategies while maintaining defensibility. To look at Twitter for example, for crypto, its ‘purpose’ is a portal to scarcity games, NFT drops, and FOMO. The function today is to spread narratives and create FOMO for markets in Web3. But what happens as the number of markets in Web3 exponentially increases? Web3 says it provides an escape, but it’s not certain whether the escape is scarcity financial games that shift attention or a new fairground with even playing rules. We were trained to play the game rather than play the game in a fair manner. \\n\\nRight now, and for the foreseeable future, follower graphs on centralized social networks are a source of significant and enduring value. We see in every dimension of our society how efficiently that influence can be translated into financial, political and cultural gain. So to ask our question another way: Will there be a time when most users’ on-chain identities and reputations are more valuable to them than their centralized social network follower count and composition? The three answer options above represent different degrees of optimism.\\n\\nIt is easy, given the trajectory of this most recent era of tech, to be pessimistic. Many of the idealistic outcomes people argued were ‘inevitable’ in 2004 now look laughably pollyannaish. But our current situation, strangely simultaneously both centralized and chaotic, is neither all bad nor intractable. The mobile and social transition that flooded — and still floods — billions of people into Web2 is providing a historic opening for human creativity and connection. For all of the algorithmic manipulation and clever incentives of social networks, these are billions of human beings with free will. They aren’t pre-programmed robots. It is factful not fanciful to recognize that they will determine the future. But they won’t do it based on vague ideals of decentralization. Only if and to the extent that Web3 truly benefits their lives will they push past our legacy networks into a next phase. \\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"aXm3OTVTK26hN2QKu82s8NjLQYPKCOMiVD2zIioCOVU\",\"timestamp\":1623952839,\"title\":\"Reputation in Web3: Ships Built on the Great Flood\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x5BA02f4Ff6Af1d9d2Af8774D10fD32Eb57d4E2E6\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xAdC1a02F1311E2D6fAcd6E2ab1B023fC02EF1CB2\"},{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0xF252945CC6bc4C5182Dba81BFe0A2F7bbD7b96C2\"}],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\",\"body\":\"a glick x tal x darkstar jam\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/70ada907-cd8c-40fc-8a13-813418b306c4.png?height=397\\u0026width=607)\\n\\nIf you walk the streets of any American neighborhood or town more than, say, 100 years-old, you’ll see ghosts. \\n\\nNot the ghosts of previous inhabitants, although that’s also possible. But the ghosts of the civic and religious organizations that were once the core organizing principle of American communal life. You can see them in the fading signs for men’s fraternities and women’s leagues that no longer meet, the labor halls renovated for restaurants and condos, and the community centers for ethnic and immigrant groups that have long since decamped for the suburbs. You can see those ghosts in the statues of beloved (often dubious) heroes that were erected by the regiments (or descendants) of veterans of various wars, the money painstakingly raised through membership subscription. Most of all, you can see them in the old churches, each for a subtly different but vigorous denomination, once the pride of their parishioners, now usually empty. \\n\\nIn his famous 1995 essay, “[Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital](http://mktgsensei.com/AMAE/Consumer%20Behavior/bowlingalone.pdf),” Robert Putnam chronicled the remarkable depth and diversity of the communal groups of the United States. Tracing the trajectory from the earliest colonists of the United States, he showed how Tocqueville’s observation that, “Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all minds” were “constantly joining together in groups,” was even more true following the waves of immigration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These newcomers, faced with difficult circumstances and often hostile neighbors, banded together for mutual support and status. They paid their dues, sat on committees, went to banquets, and advocated for collective causes. And because even long-settled Americans were migrants as they moved West, similar ‘joining behaviors’ spread to the newer cities and towns. \\n\\nBut beginning with the end of World War II, this trend began to sharply reverse. Secularization, smaller families, the automobile and new housing patterns, changing professional expectations, the rising equality of women and the impact of television are all likely causes. The Baby Boomers drove massive social movements, but they didn’t join voluntary membership associations, organizations and churches like their parents and grandparents did. And their kids even less. \\n\\n\\u003e The effects have been profound.\\n\\nAmerican communities founded on intense associational activity now have a civic participation vacuum. Associations once mobilized their constituents for specific improvements but now only local governments -- often elected by tiny numbers of voters, or self-appointed small business groups -- serve as public custodians. While there have always been good reasons for certain groups of Americans to fear and distrust the government, the lack of faith or even interest in our local institutions is now universal. It’s so endemic we don’t notice it. It’s hard to imagine how it might be different.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, we hear reminders concerning the importance of local newspapers and media. Opinion pieces shout about how communities facing political corruption or economic collapse are helpless without journalistic watch-dogs. But this is asking far too much from a newspaper. The problem is vastly deeper. Even when enterprising reporters uncover local scandals or promote essential reforms, it is clear that without well-organized, funded and representative citizen groups, there’s almost no effect. *Financial support for local media without a revolution in civic engagement is probably pointless.*\\n\\nBut is a revolution in civic engagement, even a small one, possible? We think so. Especially if we start small and focus on issues of relevance to people’s daily lives. And we think smart contracts and token ownership will ultimately play a decisive enabling function, block by block. \\n\\n**A New DAO: Local ~~News~~ Services**\\n\\nLet’s imagine something much smaller than a city, smaller than a neighborhood. An activity whose purpose is to bring the community together in a participatory manner in order to drive value, civic engagement and trust: the street fair. \\n\\nIn this scenario, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is formed for a particular street or business district. All participants in the fair ‘zone’ are awarded tokens by proving that they’re residents of the community (ie. a real address, or some other verification, a certain number per adult, a certain number per kid). Everybody automatically gets more every week. And like many DAOs, residents also earn more tokens for doing listed service actions. \\n\\nMerchants would rent booths from the DAO on a competitively auctioned basis. Community members would be rewarded in cash or tokens for helping out The Fair, like setting up and taking down booths, picking up trash or providing entertainment. But community members would also receive tokens for DAO management tasks. These tasks are differentiated in that they are focused on influential decisions for community decisioning like screening and voting on proposals (mainly, which services are needed and what the payment is, what merchants are approved, etc.). \\n\\nAs the street fair (hopefully) becomes nicer and better attended, booth prices will rise -- after all, more visitors, more value to the merchants. Tokens could also be bought from other owners, but voting is proportioned using the [quadratic governance model](https://medium.com/eximchain/quadratic-voting-smart-contracts-powerful-governance-model-b8efa4ddeef1) - where additional tokens only provide decreasingly additional incremental voting power. If the model worked, more neighborhoods could adopt it. When there are enough street fair DAOs, an index fund could be created allowing investors to own a diverse basket of neighborhood fairs and generating more liquidity for token owners. Essentially, street fair DAOs turn streets into a community’s economic asset.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ad92527-53e6-49ae-a877-7503cd60587e.png?height=366\\u0026width=546)\\n\\n**But why do we need tokens or a DAO to do any of this?**\\n\\nThese are all things that local non-profits already manage. At least in some places, it’s true that in some ‘healthy’ communities, existing institutions can run and grow successful events. But the management and organizational ‘overhead’ of traditional associations often exceeds the will and ability of potential participants. If you’ve ever been part of a community or school group, you understand the often prohibitive burden. It’s not only the time commitment of planning meetings — it’s the social dynamics where a few very active members dominate and others are ignored and relegated to less important tasks. But by moving to a DAO model, these issues become easier. \\n\\nOne way to think about on-chain governance is that it combines many of the best aspects of online communities with those of more traditional organizations. Unlike local associations, local message boards, chat rooms and Nextdoor or Facebook Groups allow citizens to share their opinions. People can do this at any time without leaving their homes, and with the comfort of anonymity if they choose. And unlike an in-person meeting, users can be involved in only the specific issue they find motivating, instead of having to sit through an entire meeting on a variety of topics (including the always delightful adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting.)\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the drawbacks of online communities for local organizing are significant and familiar. The low barrier to entry, the anonymity, the ease of interaction all leads to trolling and flame-wars, often over the smallest of disagreements. The lack of organizational structure leads to talk without action. Even when an online community does sprout real-world activity, the manifestation tends to be disorganized, diffuse and difficult to sustain.\\n\\nDAOs have strong answers to both sets of problems--\\n\\n- **traditional, in-person organizations**: smart contracts motivate participation by rewarding broader engagement, utilize online asynchronous interaction modes, and automate much of the drudgery of group decision-making. (You don’t need to approve the minutes for a blockchain-based entity.)\\n- **online communities**: DAOs add the structure necessary for determining real-world action and the real money, the practical means of aggregating and allocating it, to fund that action in the real world. (Chat rooms don’t have bank accounts.)\\n\\nSo let’s now zoom one step out. In addition to something like a street fair, other local entities might also issue tokens, from loyalty programs for small businesses, to support systems for parks and schools, to membership NFTs for performance spaces, to community-run traffic safety projects to anti-corruption campaigns. An active citizen might own tokens in dozens of local efforts, some in which they are a major participant, others in which they are more a casual observer. We can see how owners would work to market their projects to each other. We can imagine an entire ‘stock market’ for a city, asset prices reflecting the growth and success of different communal projects and efforts. We can envision how such liquidity dynamics would dramatically reduce the ‘cost of capital’ for any local ‘social’ entrepreneur and venture.\\n\\nIn this context, the mission of local news and information takes on an entirely new dimension. Instead of holding it responsible for all civic failures, the local news site becomes a portal to projects. Here could be hosted reviews of their progress, and perhaps even the marketplace where the tokens are promoted, tracked, bought, sold and traded. And of course, that local news site would itself be collectively owned, organized as a DAO and managed via tokens. \\n\\n*Consider how significant this change would be*. The newspaper emerged in the context of intensely active civic associations and local enterprises. It both reported on those organizations, including their many disputes, and acted as one itself. Small towns and immigrant communities alike supported thriving news concerns. Their pages were filled with advertisements and articles about community events and causes. Every dot on the railroad map had a local paper. At one point in the early 20th Century, New York City had six competing Yidddish dailies. The Statue of Liberty itself was a newspaper fundraising campaign. But as civic engagement declined, and as a response to the media's most dominant business models, the newspaper departed from its natural focus and pushed towards scale. It had to compete with television. More scale meant a broader focus on the content itself (outside of the community) and a larger opportunity to monetize through advertising or subscriptions. But it backfired. \\n\\nWhy? Because scale is the antonym of local. It’s the opposite. A scaled approach means removing community needs and participation from the forefront of value, which means an emphasis of *reporting on* communities versus *reporting of* those communities. Business models drive product strategy, and while we can’t retroactively return to how the local newspapers used to be structured, we can introduce new models that will drive its evolution into the next phase of value, moving from news broadcaster to civic engagement funnel. \\n\\nAs a platform that was incentivized to drive healthy ownership and engagement in local efforts, the local news DAO would be constantly innovating new ways to drive awareness of the best projects and caution of the risky ones. As members of the DAO, token holders (community residents) of the news site would be empowered to make influential decisions as to what gets covered, where assets are attributed to and what information would best service the community at large. In this way, the news site and the underlying civic associations become a virtuous circle, interest driving ownership and thus more engagement.\\n\\n**But are these innovations enough to reverse the decades-long decline of local civic associations?**\\n\\nYour answer to that question depends on what you believe to be the source of that decline. We look back with amazement at the sheer number of local associational relationships our grandparents and great-grandparents had, their involvement with churches and synagogues, with charities, lodges and clubs, commitments that occupied vast amounts of their time and lasted their whole lives. But this actually understates how differently earlier generations saw their place in the world. For them, especially if they were immigrants, there was no ‘choosing’ to be part of these communities. Their belonging was an unchanging fact of reality as they understood it. They couldn’t opt-out. The only question was how selflessly and successfully they would participate. \\n\\nFor most Americans today, this worldview is unimaginable. In their 2010 paper, [The Weirdest people in the world?](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.proquest.com/openview/196dc885b5d6d0ac0f53ac71b45caf76/1?pq-origsite%3Dgscholar%26cbl%3D47829\\u0026sa=D\\u0026source=editors\\u0026ust=1622635032822000\\u0026usg=AOvVaw3Tbe9TmXyDwlyRBLBjvrBi), Joseph Henrich, Ara Norenzayan and Steven J. Heine described how Western social scientists have routinely under-estimated how unusual modern American psychology is compared to the rest of the world. Using the acronym ‘WEIRD’ (Western, educated, industrial, rich and democratic), they noted how a whole corpus of psychology tests once believed to reveal universal human traits, having used American college students as their test subjects, were actually unique to specific Western populations. Now seen in contrast to tests done with Asians or Africans, it became evident how contemporary Westerners ground their worldviews in the radical notion of the individual. Subsequent experiments revealed how immigrants to the West transition from the ‘traditional’ communal or tribal perspectives to this WEIRD psychology within one or two generations. From these discoveries, it seems clear that our great-grandparents brought their communal orientation with them, from their home countries, and the great flourishing of ‘joining’ that Tocqueville described and that Putnam documents was their adaptation of belonging within the relative freedom of American society. We see the same behavior, that expectation of community commitment, among many new immigrants today.\\n\\nUnlike them, however, most of us are truly WEIRD. We cannot go back to a time when our families and our neighbors assumed evenings and weekends would be spent on communal efforts. For good or bad, we begin with the primacy of the person. And any cleareyed revival of civic life needs to be based in that reality. DAOs do that. You aren’t presumed to be obligated to engage -- you’re paid to. You aren’t a parishioner or adherent -- you’re an owner. You have an emotional connection to a collective mission -- but it’s framed in explicit economic self-interest. You don’t belong to a DAO — *it belongs to you*. \\n\\nInspired by the potential of these concepts, crypto-dreamers are [envisioning](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), in their WEIRD way like the pioneers of earlier centuries, entirely new cities based on smart contracts and tokens. Some talk about designing their new towns ‘in the Metaverse first,’ then raising money to build them in the real world, usually in some state or country hospitable to libertarian ideals. These visions are thrilling and important, but there’s just as much relevance for blockchain in the cities and towns that exist today. It’s possible the often disastrous record of new cities based on utopian ideals recommends we seek to solve the pernicious problems we already have rather than create new ones from scratch. It’s very likely that the totally new and the rebooted city will inform each other, like a testnet and a mainnet. In any case and in any setting, these crypto-local concepts -- and the tools to support them -- will take a long time to perfect. It will take a lot of failures before we begin to make progress, so we should begin right away. Just as the civic associations of our grandparents took centuries to rise and fall, blockchain-based organizing will require generations to evolve into a perfected and stable form. All those ghosts peer at us from the past, waiting for us to get started, remaking our cities.\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"eYRttcLec0IXODpzLFsHZTRdzuWosBwfyVKnSc93NdA\",\"timestamp\":1622631806,\"title\":\"Cities of Ghosts Await Their DAO Revival\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\",\"body\":\"*a [flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) x [glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) x [tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [dicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) joint *\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/576dfd5e-59cf-480b-a05d-df015d40216f.png?height=918\\u0026width=610)\\n\\nIn the morning, you’re picking crops on the farm. By afternoon, you enter the arena to do battle. This isn’t a remake of the movie Gladiator. It’s one Anon’s day in the world of crypto games. As DeFi, NFTs and other blockchain-based technologies compete for mindshare, the entire crypto world is not only borrowing heavily from game mechanics but increasingly becoming a single massive integrated game itself. This is the inevitable result of user sovereignty. Interoperable protocols provide the freedom to move between thousands of dapps and blockchains, so developers are leaning into gamification in order to put a leash on existing users and keep them coming back for more. \\n\\nGame designers are, of course, experts in terms of keeping people engaged for long periods of time, even more than social media companies. Where social media companies have a recurring strategy to get someone to engage and then keep them engaged (ie. monetizing their attention through ads), games are different. Games look to draw you in at an initial (often free) engagement, but then encourage you to build status and identity within the experience itself. Mapping all this to crypto is easy. The users make purchases (see: NFTs) that make your social involvement (see: social tokens) unique. The experience blends intrinsic and extrinsic incentives to keep you invested (financially \\u0026 socially) in the experience itself.\\n\\nDespite this focus on gamification however, crypto games continue to struggle with designing exciting game mechanics that both drive long term engagement and live up to the decentralized and democratic ideals of the blockchain. Even the most popular games such as CryptoKitties and Top Shots have fairly similar bell-shaped curves in terms of transaction volumes and DAUs. We see significant concentration with limited adoption by broader groups participating at a fairly skewed playtime.\\n\\nWhy is this? Well, for the most part, cryptogames are borrowing pay-to-win and other non-meritocratic game mechanics instead of building the accomplishment loops that drive user/player delight, long-term engagement and mass adoption. They reward power users and big spenders, leading to a cycle of ‘rich getting richer.’ All this is based on non-skill-based mechanics that reward wallet size above all else. For example, users who buy rich assets are granted future potential benefits (more inflation, more exclusive opportunities to purchase in early sales) leading to them getting richer and putting themself further ahead. That’s not to say there aren’t success stories -- nor opportunities for skill, hard work and grinding to be rewarded -- but until the ecosystem learns to adapt the best of games, by rewarding all kinds of human capabilities, it cannot reach its full potential.\\n\\n**Cities \\u0026 Culture**\\n\\n[In Economic Flows \\u0026 Cultural Products](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI), we discussed how the path of protocol and creator (ie. DAOs) adopting will mirror the growth of culture in our first cities. That is to say, culture and creation via patronage and communal backing. Ironically, games were one of the first major applications and products built by crypto enthusiasts looking to drive greater adoption and mass participation in their new decentralized economy. In 2018, many of the biggest NFT marketplaces (OpenSea and Bitski) went all-in on crypto games as many proclaimed they were the future of crypto adoption and that crypto was the future of gaming. \\n\\nThis made sense. Gaming was already one of the most popular activities in the digital world, with significant overlap between the crypto and gamer audiences. And looking at the example of both Facebook and mobile, it was evident how important the rise of platform-specialized games had been to the popularity of those platforms. On top of that, gaming seemed like a particularly perfect fit for decentralized technology. Players have long been used to purchasing digital goods and participating in digital economies, with a natural belief that games ought to allow players more freedom and control over their virtual possessions. Vitalik Buterin has credited Blizzard’s arbitrary destruction of his World of Warcraft Siphon Life Spell as impetus to create Ethereum. \\n\\nThree years later, despite all these efforts and focus, crypto games still haven’t seen anything like the viral adoption we saw within Facebook and mobile. Most remain much more like speculative investment vehicles than entertainment hits. And with high gas fees and challenges in scalability and infrastructure, the player ranks remain small and concentrated.\\n\\nThere are several reasons why crypto games haven’t scaled to mass adoption-- \\n\\n- **Platform**: platform issues remain rampant. Today there are high transaction costs and problems with scalability, problems that would be even worse if user bases and demand were bigger. Plus there are big ugly unavoidable questions regarding the benefits of decentralization to the high-twitch vivid environments many serious gamers demand. \\n\\n- “**Revenue**”: business models remain challenged and misaligned. Today the opportunity for game-makers to earn a SHIT-TON of money from sale of land and items leads them to maximize these types of products -- this can make the core of the game suffer from ‘asset inequality,’ an experience too expensive for entry-level players, and a sort of preening Yuppie-ness that isn’t that cool.\\n\\n- **Immersion**: there is insufficient immersion - the crypto-ness of the games (many are thinly veiled yield farming) and interoperability of assets across games into marketplaces reduces the game’s intensity and believability and its sense of place and escape.\\n\\nMore importantly though, crypto games are competing with DeFi itself and, in that, often losing. If the game is just thinly veiled speculation and/or yield farming, why not just do that with the thousands of fun tokens minus the game pretext? It may actually be simpler to play the purer version, and, with the addition of social media group behaviors, even more fun.\\n\\n\\u003e DeFi is a more accessible game than crypto games and the rules can’t be changed by any single entity. \\n\\nIt’s possible that, because the use of the blockchain for the trading of digital assets as NFTs is so obvious (and lucrative) that crypto game designers have missed the larger possibilities of decentralization. Rather than centering their communities on competitions of cooperation and creativity, we get shallow status contests and themed casinos. And incentives can be seriously mis-aligned. With crypto games, the original creator can mint more NFTs at any point which causes inflation. \\n\\nThere’s no question that videogames have a God-dictator that determines the story, controls the economy, and tries to create the best possible experience. This helps make the games more fun and playable by altering the “meta” and ensuring playability and balance. This authority may be camouflaged in games, but it's always there. And it is essential to how successful games work. DeFi, in comparison, is competing 'games' (blockchains and dapps) within a metagame (the game of token vs token), with nobody in charge, or perhaps lots of people in charge. In the world of crypto, everything and nothing is a game at the same time. \\n\\nIn many ways, the problems facing crypto games reflect the inherent tension between those aspects of a game that ‘want’ to be decentralized and those better or more easily accomplished by a centralized solution. The development and management of innovative gameplay experiences, complex storyworlds and game economies are simply easier in a centralized setting. New crypto users, with their need for fiat and customer service, make this problem even more acute. Perhaps the two most popular gateways to crypto, Coinbase and Dapper’s TopShots, accepted the need for a compromise, but it is often an uncomfortable synthesis. The disruptive capabilities and ambitions of crypto sit restlessly within a bounded environment, like a caged wild animal looking for its opportunity to escape and wreak havoc. How to bridge this gap? Everyone agrees, to use the most common example, that it would be awesome if Fortnite enabled you to buy and sell and use Fortnite stuff outside of Fortnite. But that stuff is only valuable because Fortnite is awesome, and that awesomeness is the product of a highly managed environment. That's not to say we will never build decentralized systems and governance for a thing like Fortnite. We can and will eventually have Creator DAOs that build and run worlds. But we're not yet very close to being able to do that. And until then, we will mainly have crypto games that are more DeFi than delightful, more on-ramp to the blockchain than an engrossing destination.\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"q7IvhRxSux5fk41ZDCEUm3uucmqZybvVBxByceRbFV4\",\"timestamp\":1621528139,\"title\":\"Balancing the Meta: The Role of Games in a Crypto World\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\",\"body\":\"a [glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) x [tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) x dicker joint\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4b8cd854-77f9-4bfd-a69f-ab68b08094d9.png?height=170\\u0026width=477)\\n\\nYou’re inspired. \\n\\nYou’ve read a bunch of articles, blog posts, and essays and suddenly see that blinding flash of realization. You’ve formulated an idea that feels new and important and worth writing down and sharing with others. You start pulling together key thoughts, quotes and citations. You organize them into an outline. You write. You edit. You publish. \\n\\nIn the old days (of last month), you’d be posting this work to a simple blog post or a newsletter. It would (hopefully) include links in the text to the sources referenced and shoutouts to those that helped inspire your ideas. The people referenced or quoted might notice. You might tag them on Twitter. They might care a little. The links would mean incremental traffic, perhaps one or two sign ups to their personal blog or newsletter. The dopamine of being referenced would be nice too. But… that’s it.\\n\\nNow, there’s a different way to create — one that positions you to *build upon* those sources of inspiration. Instead of using links and tags, by minting your essay as an NFT, you can attribute it, socially and financially, on-chain, to the authors and articles that influenced you. Last Tuesday, the brilliant folks at Mirror introduced the notion of ‘splits.’ [To use their language](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw), splits are a native feature that let you route funds continuously to an unlimited number of Ethereum addresses, according to a set of percentage allocations. Splits can be used to share the revenue generated from a sale of an NFT with any set number of collaborators. You can specify that Jonathan should get 20% and Tal should get 40% and so on until 100% of the treasury is allocated. When money comes in, it programmably flows out based on these percentages. This is all handled by the smart contract. Trustless and public.\\n\\nBut another way to use splits, and the more systemically significant one, is to attribute your sources of revelation. As the Mirror team put it, “collaboration then extends to who inspired your idea and to what extent.” In this use-case, you specify that, say, Patrick Rivera contributed 7% of the inspiration, while Packy McCormick provided 4% and Sari Azout and Jad Esber did 12%. When revenue is generated by your NFT, they automatically get their cut. \\n\\nSplits take behaviors that used to be purely intrinsic and status driven (social cred) and make them financially extrinsic (social + economic cred). It evolves actions and concepts which are inherently viral by pairing them with an economic incentive. When someone gets attributed to an article, even if it’s not a lot of money in her wallet, it feels good. (Packy did it for us, and it felt awesome.) And when people feel good, they tend to want to keep feeling good and make others feel good; first, by creating more content that will inspire other people. But also by, in turn, attributing the people who have inspired their work. By paying it forward, by being a good member of the community of writers, by in effect ‘paying it backward’ and acknowledging what others have given them. Of course in doing so, they are more likely themselves to be attributed again.\\n\\nBut like any foundational change, this will not only impact the way we drive value from the finished product, but influence the creation of the product itself. Splits and other tools like them introduce a business model around the creation of content, going beyond existing methods that focus purely on post-publish production and distribution. This concept has the ability to drive a significant value change to foundational content creation because the financial flows can go much deeper than one level. This isn’t about changing surface level citations and crediting, but about fundamentally altering the entire production, ownership and funding model for digital content.\\n\\nOur friends from Mirror note, “because crypto allows economics to route between any smart contracts, split value can flow beyond just people to entities like... NFTs.” So when you attribute Sari and Jad’s essay, any revenue you generate can flow proportionally and pool in their NFT. And if they wanted, that pool could continue to flow, according to the attribution splits they in turn determined, into the NFTs that inspired their work. Of course, the same dynamic would occur if someone created an NFT that attributed your essay. Revenue starting at the top would flow all the way down to the foundational inspirations. What used to be hyperlinks and mentions now becomes a financial structure that helps strengthen and fund an entire ecosystem. NFTs and splits have finally given hyperlinks a business model.\\n\\nMatt Stephenson laid it out perfectly in his recent essay, ‘How the First Great Finding in Empirical Science Was Lost for Decades.’ Focusing on the potential for cascading attribution as a funding source for basic scientific research, he called it a ‘[Splitstream](https://s.mirror.xyz/vKZToDiv68BGnKx6HjUqYHKnJOI5IpU95dbrETU5Seg).’\\n\\n\\u003e The SplitStream is a system in which portions of an NFT sale may flow to some or all of the works the NFT cites, with those cited works then sending some of their funds further along to the works they cite, and so on.\\n\\n[Sari and Jad seize](https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/etHY_neWXosxDJpGOhzuwi-cB0qOvMco_iwO5yJ1Ai0) on the significance of this flow for deep foundational work--\\n\\n\\u003e But what if your back-catalog wasn’t stagnant, but rather an ever-evolving source of passive income? What if the value of your work was driven by the number of references and citations, and more references meant more dollars? What if the ROI of an essay that took hundreds of hours to write was orders of magnitude higher than those designed for virality or disposability?\\n\\nBut where does the revenue come from? How does the funding get into this proposed attribution system? What will power this new business model? Are people seriously going to buy essay-NFTs or other content NFTs like they buy Cryptopunks and Beeples?\\n\\nLikely not. At least not for every content format. While there have been a number of very successful sales of essay-NFTs, it’s just not a perfect fit for the medium. While very old and important books are valuable, essays don’t hold the same perceived store of value as art and collectibles. There isn’t an existing cultural tradition of selling, much less auctioning, written content in the same way. \\n\\nBut when we unpack the reason people are buying NFTs, we see three interconnected motivations: \\n\\n- **Identity**: a desire to be personally associated with a particular creation\\n- **Status**: an effort to support a particular creator, and thus be included in their future works\\n- **Equity**: a hope that the asset may generate profit if it increases in value\\n\\nAnd those motivations are relevant for every content format. So for revenue and funding of any content format, we just need to enable mechanisms that satisfy these motivations while being both ‘native’ and natural.\\n\\nFor writing, instead of outright purchasing an essay, there could be the notion of supporting the essay, of patronizing it. Suppose there are some finite number of support 'spots' for an essay. As a curator who admires an essay, I could purchase the privilege of being acknowledged as a supporter of it by embedding my name or DAOs name in the foundation of the UX. The support capital would flow into the NFT, and then out to the various splits of collaborators and attributors. In this way, I would also be the owner of my ‘spot’ and would be able to sell my ‘spot’ to someone else. I could perhaps even make a profit, as the essay’s place in the web of attribution becomes more established and better recognized.\\n\\nOf course, the list of essays a particular person or DAO supports would itself be a useful index and source of valuable notifications. By connecting with content in this way, the community acknowledges supporters as essential curators, establishing their reputation while providing  a venue for others to follow their selections. So splits have not only potentially created a new funding model for content but for curation as well.\\n\\nIsn’t there in this system an inherent ‘free rider’ problem? Why wouldn’t someone read all these essays without ever paying to support one? Why wouldn’t someone writing an essay borrow ideas without ever attributing them as his or her source of inspiration? The answer is that they could. Just as someone can ‘consume’ an NFT without owning one. But doing so puts that person outside the community of ideas, and less able to fully participate in its benefits. Someone who never supports is unlikely to be supported. Someone who never attributes is unlikely to be attributed. All of these actions are recorded on the blockchain, transparent and permanent. He can be a free rider, but his track record will make that obvious, just as someone who is a steady conduit for value will be known and rewarded.\\n\\nWhat we are really describing -- what Sari and Jad and Patrick and Brian are pointing us to -- is a composable architecture for ideas: NFT-essays building on each other, precisely as Jesse described, as [media legos](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1301673263840534528). \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/691fc17f-5c33-484c-8caa-648cd8be982f.png?height=182\\u0026width=940)\\n\\nUnlike the current Web, where the game is capturing unwitting traffic and funneling it towards the companies paying us, this concept of composable ideas inverts that pernicious tendency. In a network of attribution, we aim to add to and acknowledge the work of others, intentionally driving economic and reputational value to instrumental work, precisely in order so that others will consider doing the same for us. In this system, we want others to build on what we have built. The result is an ever-climbing tower of creativity, where ideas flow up and gratitude flows down.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/122ce981-9847-490d-b201-83579877481d.png?height=680\\u0026width=660)\\n\\nNot all nodes in this architecture can be of equal influence. Some will be much more significant than others. There will be foundational content pieces that are the end-point recipients of the attributions of tens of thousands of other creations. There will be other content pieces that provide essential bridges and flows between seemingly separate topic-networks. There will be curators whose lists of proudly supported content make up the definitive canon on a particular subject and whose support funded the thinking that built a whole new field of investigation and invention. But it is an architecture that gives every individual creator a platform and culture in which their ideas can radiate if they are useful to others.\\n\\nSo this new graph isn’t about who you ‘friend’ or follow, but who you attribute, who you support, and who inspires and supports you. Not as social gestures, but inscribed in smart contracts that deliver economic benefits. Not as traffic driven, but as credit given. Is this a relevant model for every kind of content? Probably not. Like the rest of the ownership economy, the places where these concepts will have the most impact are those domains where a specific community perceives a great deal of merit. Blockchain-based attribution is unlikely to change the business model behind an ephemeral news story, product review or TV show summary. But it is also possible that it changes the way those markets can be served. In addition to the competitive scrambling to be the first and most viral Mandalorian recap, there may also be room for a community of writers, and of writers’ collectives (DAOs and multi-sig publications), who create more thoughtful and lasting criticism by building on and attributing each others’ ideas. The only question is whether there are readers and writers who value it.\\n\\nSplits, supports and attributions are the pillars of a new Web based on NFT economics. Leapfrogging the fragility of links, we can permanently record these more meaningful associations on the blockchain. Instead of a business based on traffic funnels and user-data harvesting, we can have transparent financial flows. The practice and culture of sharing ownership and credit can change the incentives of creation. Through an architecture of composable ideas, we can add to and amplify each other’s efforts that build a tower of innovative work, solidly established on the recognition and reward of its foundations. \\n\\n\\n[Attributions](split://0x38f60E0C7599Ac3088fBEea7552e3064E3C34D40?network=mainnet)\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"jQPCNL3XvdzfZFUvgk1kaupkl5GJD7OrBH5GgrD3FaY\",\"timestamp\":1620920801,\"title\":\"The Next Social Graph: Splits, Supports and Attributions\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI\",\"body\":\"a [glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) x [tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [flynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) x [darkstar](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) jam\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/999034c9-4b69-4ab7-ab2e-b8cc11fe7cb2.png?height=377\\u0026width=610)\\n\\nAt the edge of the steppes was a bend in the great river. On one side lived herdsmen, on the other were forest people. The nomads valued the forest-dwellers axes and baskets. The forest-dwellers loved the herder’s hides and wool. As the two sides became more familiar with each other, they began to trade. \\n\\nWithin a few years, there was a temporary camp in that bend of the river. It was a perfect place to meet. The two sides would do business, swap stories and eat together. Soon traders were coming throughout the year. The camp became permanent and then became a town. People lived there all the time, a new community formed of people from both sides, catering to the growing number of visitors bringing goods to sell. \\n\\nThanks to its unique location for efficient trade, the town grew quickly and became rich. The richest people built houses, but they also did something else: they built public places. They used their new wealth to make their town even more attractive. They built temples, theaters, schools and libraries, and they funded the priests, playwrights, teachers and scholars who filled them with culture. \\n\\nThis, more or less, is the founding pattern of most of our great cities, the origin story of much of our civilization. A location uniquely conducive to trade becomes a permanent settlement. As the trade grows, the wealth of the community does also, and this wealth is used to fund spaces and content to glorify the town, enlighten and entertain its citizens and attract more visitors.\\n\\nWhen we think about the creation of culture on the blockchain, it is tempting for media people to imagine it freestanding. As if culture were raught whole cloth. [We have written about Creator DAOs](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao) almost as startups emerging from only the imagination of their founders. That’s certainly possible, and those projects will succeed when the products they create are immensely popular. But there’s a more likely path for the first of these projects, mirroring the growth of culture in those first cities. That is to say, culture and creation via patronage and communal backing.\\n\\nOn the crypto map, the most successful protocols are like that bend in the river, the perfect point for value to flow in both directions. A locus for value creation and trade. And when the protocols granted ownership, they went from being purely transactional to communal. They became settlements. (Ali Yahya, Devon Zuegel, Denis Nazarov and Jesse Walden [riffed on that exact analogy in this wonderful A16Z-hosted discussion](https://a16z.com/2018/07/26/cryptonetworks-cities-analogies/).) The inevitable next step is the development of culture around those settlements, and given the soaring value of protocol treasuries, these communities have the financial means to support it.\\n\\nWhat does that look like? \\n\\nCrypto is a ‘nation’ in which communities are now sprouting with their own distinct cultures. The simplest examples are the meme-art that has erupted around tokens. Bitcoin’s laser eyes. Beeple’s Into the Ether. All supported by the flow of funding from passionate investor-fans into NFTs. Another example are the simple websites that have emerged to help newcomers understand and take advantage of the protocol. [Here’s the Zed Gazette](https://zedgazette.com/top-articles/), self-appointed newspaper for the horse-racing game Zed Run, supported by [merch](https://zedstore.run). Another is [The First Mint](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thefirstmint), a fan-created media brand for the popular NBA Top Shot. But Uniswap is leading the next-generation of this idea. The protocol is enabling [artists](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1390042383065178114) to design on-chain SVG generators that will create unique NFTs to represent LP positions on the protocol. \\n\\nBut these examples are just the beginning. As a protocol evolves, there is a sense of responsibility from participating token holders to maintain and evolve the ecosystem being built around it. Like early civilization, there is both a proactive and reactive investment to foster the “city” in order to strengthen its infrastructure, accessibility and desirability. As token holders are owners of the protocol and are incentivized to have it succeed, the role of tokens moves from transactional (i sell for profit) to wealth (i hold for proprietary rights). And this mechanism drives development that welcomes more residents as well as tourists to visit and partake in the civilization’s developments and culture. If the meme is the message, then a protocols’ greatest moat and differentiator may very well end up being the culture it spawned around it.\\n\\nAnd the funding and interest exists for vastly more ambitious creative projects than the crypto equivalent of training materials, corporate PR and investor relations websites. Look at the scale of these community’s resources: https://open-orgs.info. This is communal wealth built at a scale and speed never before seen.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8051d2dc-9704-4341-948c-e96d7ae3f87d.png?height=556\\u0026width=1008)\\n\\nSo what sort of creations could be funded by the protocols and built out by Creator DAOs? \\n\\n- The most obvious is ‘identity art’ for the protocol community to enjoy and share. An Artist DAO could create a whole world of NFTs, tens of thousands of unique items to be dropped to token-holders, perhaps depending on their bag size, history and contributions to the community. As we move into the Metaverse, these NFT could evolve into protocol-branded wearables or vehicles, the meta-equivalent of t-shirts and bumper stickers. (Hey, not all culture is high brow.) \\n\\n- Another valuable project would be definitive reference material on blockchain projects, a so-called ‘Encyclopedia Cryptologica.’ There’s barely any quality, carefully reviewed information on most projects, tokens, concepts -- and where there is, it’s not easily searchable. Only a DAO (or its Wikipedia-like precursor) could mobilize and compensate the huge number of experts and researchers necessary to maintain a living encyclopedia for our exponentially expanding gowing crypto world. \\n\\n- Of course such a project suggests that financial media and ‘literacy’ programs may in general be worthwhile cultural institutions. Imagine a 24/7 CNBC of crypto -- interviews with leading developers and investors, regulators and politicians -- but entirely run by a Creator DAO. Imagine crypto-literacy programs to help potential investors understand the risks of leverage, understand liquidity, volatility, etc.\\n\\n- On the other side of the crypto equation, computer science and crypto-business courses would be valuable educational content products. Investing in these projects may be analogous to community-like events which encourage you to support and contribute to the community.\\n\\n- But there could also be other media types produced, like movies. Crypto is about enabling decentralization to promote creativity and prohibit censorship. So how about a film series about how marginalized creators and communities are using the blockchain to enable and express themselves? Or about artists and inventors who fought centralized control in the past? How about a whole film festival?\\n\\n- New prosperous communities often invent and patronize their own musical culture, a sound and style that stands for their unique perspective on the world. 18th Century European bourgeoisie loved the opera. Baby boomers had rock and roll. Just in time, we have DAO systems like Songcamp, where artists can collaborate and share in the results. Is this the melody of the blockchain? Click and be amazed: (https://twitter.com/songcampdotband/status/1389285939277701122?s=20)\\n\\n- It’s also not hard to imagine funding for debate societies, legal and political conferences and lobbying efforts, even full-fledged science and technology journals. We may even see funding for IRL social events, like Happy Hours, or their digital equivalents. \\n\\nOf course, different protocols have different missions and their communities will support their own distinct cultural products. A blockchain devoted to lower electricity consumption for climate purposes will foster creativity around ecological issues. And, indeed, you can see that happening within the NFT community of Hicetnunc, minted on a chain those artists consider better for the planet.\\n\\nWhat’s really interesting about the relationship between economics and culture is how the culture flows back into the economy. Crossroads towns that built out shrines and cathedrals for their often flimsily-historical patron saints attracted more traffic to their markets. These structures attract tourism and talent that plant their roots and build upon the foundation of what already exists. And the seriousness of the devotion for that culture drove a sense of civic duty that caused citizens to invest in and defend their cities. \\n\\nWe cannot underestimate the enormous emotional power that creative products instill in the communities that invest in and embrace them. It often takes time for the full significance of these products to emerge. Their potential impact is rarely obvious. The paths they take can be strange. Consider the song that has become the anthem of New York City, played at sporting events, parades and, most strikingly, during the darkest hours of the Covid epidemic. *“New York New York”* was written as a title tune to a forgettable 1977 Robert DeNiro-Liza Minelli movie, then picked up by Sinatra. Somehow, the words perfectly represent the city. *Bomp, bomp, bah-de-dah.*.How many people have been subtly inspired to visit or move to New York because of it? How many people found hope in it this past year? The song has become so ingrained in the city’s DNA that is no longer the song from the movie or the song from Sinatra. It’s New York’s song. \\n\\nWe may be seeing the beginnings of this kind of culture formation in crypto. In fact, it may be even turbocharged, as crypto enables the financialization of social and communal activity in a manner never before seen. This makes clear the need and role for ambitious and thoughtful cultural governance now that creative structures, businesses and behaviors are being built on top of the protocol’s foundation. As proverbial neighborhoods sprout up, subcultures will be built in reaction to the constructs and its visitors and identity will evolve. In doing so, this activity will begin to invite criticism of how or what is built, by those most deeply invested in the protocol and the community it’s fostered. There will be disagreements. There will be overly kitsch and propagandistic creation. But in the end, the protocols that can produce the most meaningful and lasting communities, in large part through content and cultural creation, will be the most lasting, wealthiest and important. In crypto, soft power is everything. \\n\\n[The proceeds of this NFT will go towards protocol treasuries mentioned and the co-authors of this post.](split://0x27E3Fdccc6e4f422f4Cc0961294e907F5f31284B?network=mainnet)\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"yEK4DdvmxwZ2l-yHWGOQs3rMsLD6RYs_phLUzSFdhAI\",\"timestamp\":1620319572,\"title\":\"Protocols and Creator DAOs: Economic Flows and Cultural Products\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao\",\"body\":\"*a [Tal](https://twitter.com/tweettal) x [Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) x [Dicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) collab*\\n\\n*Web2 communities were built on intrinsic incentives. Web3 communities will take the intrinsic mechanisms of Web2 and meld them with extrinsic incentives,*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/57f2ec24-4ce0-48f4-92ee-bd55c0b41b99.png?height=146\\u0026width=312)\\n\\nWe have in the past discussed how the blockchain concept of a ‘decentralized autonomous organization’ (DAO) might apply to groups of people who want to make stuff. We called this theoretical format a ‘Creator DAO.’ In this paradigm, a team or community interested in making something would implement a smart contract according to which tokens in the project would be granted to contributors, customers or investors, in return for their labor or money. \\n\\nFor example, a group of people who wanted to design a line of shoes might sell tokens in their project to people who believed in their vision. These tokens would bestow several privileges on their holders. They might provide token-holders with discounted pricing and/or priority access to the project’s product. They could give token-holders the ability to vote on shoe designs or other project decisions. They might even provide token-holders with a share of profits when such exist. And of course, the tokens could be sold to other people for profit, if as a result of the success of the project the value of the token increased. In addition to cash, tokens might be earned through work on the project. Designers, marketers, manufacturing and financial experts could be awarded tokens in return for their involvement in the shoe project. Even smaller contributions, like helping a social campaign go viral or providing survey feedback on packaging, could result in token grants. \\n\\nSo how is this different from crowdfunding like Kickstarter or membership platforms like Patreon? These three frameworks have plenty in common, most importantly, the goal of making it possible for more people to make stuff. But the main difference that a Creator DAO provides is the notion of ownership. You are not simply *supporting* a project. Through the token, you *possess* a piece of it. And, within the rules of its smart contract, are free to use the token as you want. You can sell it, stake it, fractionalize it, include it in an index, take advantage of all of the liquidity-enhancing mechanisms DeFi enables. In other words, with a CreatorDAO, in addition to wanting to help people make stuff because you like the stuff they’ll make, you get financial incentives. You are an investor. A true owner.\\n\\nSo then how is it different from traditional investing? Again, there’s plenty of similarities here too. Investors own parts of businesses, and depending on the terms and size of their ownership, can vote on issues affecting the company, receive dividends, and at some point, sell their share. The difference is the more fluid and flexible nature of a token. Most companies don’t sell shares to the public until fairly late in their evolution given the transaction, regulatory and coordination costs associated with going public. Meanwhile, private company shares are difficult to sell, generally locked up, either by contract or practical reality, for years. Tokens are typically issued early if not at the beginning of a project. They can and do sell whenever the owner desires. And the potential use-cases are as broad as the creators can imagine. It’s slow and expensive, for instance, to reward a small contribution to a traditional company with an equity grant. But tokens make it easy and inexpensive. You’d never have a special shoe design available only to private equity investors. There wouldn’t be enough of them for that to be worthwhile. With tokens, it makes perfect sense.\\n\\nPut another way, in order to engage as many people as possible as deeply as possible, Creator DAOs intertwine two kinds of motivations that are usually seen as far apart: social and financial. A ‘traditional’ content website, for example, would never consider its investors and community members in the same way, or try to provide them with a single currency as reward for their distinct kinds of participation. Which isn’t to say that pre-DAO creators didn’t recognize the need to reward their users. They definitely (and increasingly) did. They just envisioned it as an entirely different system of incentives, running parallel to but disconnected from those of its investors. Or perhaps more accurately, subordinate to the company’s financial system. If you think about it, a major feature of the most successful Web 2.0 products was precisely this: the creation of currencies that were valued but weren’t directly financial. Remember ‘gamification?’ Likes, follows, friends and badges -- all so central to the social web we barely notice anymore that all of these were inventions designed to incentivize free labor. In many ways, this has been the core focus of the last few decades of consumer Internet.\\n\\n**Web2: Tapping Intrinsic Incentives**\\n\\nWhen The Huffington Post looked to grow participation on their [platform in 2010](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/introducing-huffpost-badg_b_557168), they introduced the behavior of **badging**. Seemingly simple, badging was responsible for the growth of The Huffington Post over any other participatory tool or tactic because the intrinsic benefits tied to the community’s status and identity encouraged engagement on platform and off. The more a community member participated in set tasks, the more benefits they unlocked. \\n\\nThis entire process started in the comments section. To encourage healthy discourse and increased engagement, users were tasked to moderate and direct conversations. This action was rewarded with a **moderator badge**. This moderator badge gave individuals permission to fully moderate discourse across all articles and be featured as commenters. There were other badges as well they gave additional benefits. For example, [the **pundits badge**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/huffpost-pundits-badge_b_691473) gave individual’s the ability to have their comments highlighted in multiple arenas, as well as the ability to leave longer comments. This made the community conversations starters. It was an engine to The Huffington Post’s growth. It benefitted The Huffington Post by keeping good conversation and discourse on their platform, thus growing their page views, revenue and market share. \\n\\nThis was done only by tapping intrinsic incentives, by enabling users to ‘earn’ within a status economy that existed only inside the website. Individuals wanted to better their reputation as a commenter or contributor and the platform enabled that. For a while, it worked incredibly well. But there was an obvious and inherent contradiction. If the Huffington Post was getting more *financially* valuable, and a major reason for that increase were the massive contributions of its motivated community, why were the members paid only in badges and not in money? When HuffPo sold to AOL, the investors got rich, the community got nothing.\\n\\n**Web3: Adding Extrinsic Incentives**\\n\\nA HuffPo based on fungible tokens, instead of badges, could have had a different outcome. The earliest and most active contributors could have been paid when the company was purchased. In fact, they could have been selling their $HUFF tokens for other valuable assets all along. Those who held on to them or bought more might even have blocked the sale. More likely, it would have evolved into an entirely different product.\\n\\nSo maybe the more interesting way to think about Creator DAOs is not in how they would change the products and companies we already know and rather what totally new creations they might make possible. By broadening the motivations for someone to assist early-stage and/or independent creators, Creator DAOs open up new opportunities outside of existing businesses and infrastructures. \\n\\nConsider local news, a market which is essential to the functioning of our real-world communities but which has become almost impossible for entrepreneurs and investors. One effort taking a different approach to this mission is *The Devil Strip* in Akron, Ohio. Faced with a need for capital as well as a commitment to deeply engage its readership, this arts and culture magazine is being structured as a co-op. Readers and workers own *The Devil Strip*:\\n\\n“[That means we are locally owned in the truest sense: Readers can become shareholders in *The Devil Strip*](https://thedevilstrip.com/co-op/). Being a shareholder means your voice will shape the future of our publication, as long as you have an Ohio address. (We cannot yet offer shares out of state for legal reasons, but we welcome donations from our friends everywhere!).\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/68530646-5b52-41c5-9f87-23328aeea39a.png?height=233\\u0026width=646)\\n\\nEven though it’s not often employed in media, at least not yet, the co-op structure is well-established and widely-used in all sorts of contexts. *The Devil Strip* can lean on generations of practical lessons and law from the co-op world. There’s every indication that it’ll work. But might this project work better as a Creator DAO?\\n\\nThere are two big advantages to Creator DAOs and tokens: liquidity and functionality. Not unlike crowdfunding, a co-op share has no financial incentive. You can’t sell it or use it to make money. That’s not necessarily a problem. It may even be a feature. There may be enough people in Akron who want the magazine so much that they are willing to fund it strictly based on that desire. Or based on the social benefits of being recognized as supportive members. And the lack of a profit motive may incentivize the collective to focus more on public benefit. But it’s possible there would be significantly more potential funders of the *The Devil Strip*, making better long term decisions, if those intrinsic motivations were intertwined with extrinsic ones. \\n\\nThe main question to ask is: Do we want shareholder’s to profit from their investment? It’s not a simple question. What makes a Creator DAO significantly different than, say, a media co-op is that the options for the latter are limited when it comes to whether and how they make money from their investment. Tokens enable fractionalization and staking, all utilities for individuals to either leverage or liquidate their ownership asset. This makes a token share of something worth more than a co-op share, even if they have the same governance and utility benefits. Tokens also enable indexing. We can imagine an index fund or on-chain investment club that invests in Creator DAOs all over the country, providing more reliable funding for projects like *The Devil Strip*. In short, token holders are incentivized financially to increase the value of their holdings and to scale such holdings. As such, one way to think about a Creator DAO is as a profit-motivated community, combining the profit and social incentives in one. \\n\\nMuch of our social and financial structures have been designed to incentivize contribution and reward participation and coordination. Incentive mechanisms have always been critical to build a healthy, highly participatory community of any kind. But historically, these systems and incentive mechanisms have been fractured and separate across spheres. We’ve had political systems for organizing participation in mass movements. We’ve had corporations and other financial structures for organizing participation in business endeavors. And we’ve had status systems for organizing participation in social activities. DAO’s potentially combine all of these structures at once. The mission of DAOs is to have everyone who can be helpful be a part of the collective, and therefore to have a suitable reward for every potential contributor. To do so, they combine financial incentives with social status and political representation. DAOs in effect, provide a brand new OS for participation. \\n\\nAnd like an OS, they enable creations that could never have been anticipated. So when thinking about Creator DAOs forget about the structures that currently exist today. Beginner’s mindset is a critical attribute to how we evolve our thinking and our products, and presenting a new paradigm to how things could be architected will not just evolve our current models but create entirely new ones for us to leverage and explore. Yes, we can port over the ‘rules and roles’ from journalism or shoe design and theorize how they can work within a DAO framework. But that limits the opportunity that the DAO introduces. It’s not about creating old stuff with a DAO.’ It’s about ‘the new stuff a DAO allows us to create.\\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"Tf9IS6yNxtPXwC5mmfi_UISe8v6BOfef2bDmQSxoJao\",\"timestamp\":1619629732,\"title\":\"Creator DAOs: An OS for Participation \",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM\",\"body\":\"An alternative history of platforms, publishing, politics, and power.\\n\\n*a [Jonathan Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick), [Tal Shachar](https://twitter.com/tweettal) \\u0026 Jarrod Dicker joint.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/48d7ce19-4d7e-4cac-a0eb-fa1fb782fb32.png?height=746\\u0026width=486)\\n\\nThere’s an alternative story of Substack. Imagine the following:\\n\\nOnce upon a time, not so long ago, some entrepreneurs started a company that offered writers an easy way to distribute and charge for their newsletters. Their business model would be elegant-- the writer would get the software for free, and only pay a percentage of their subscription revenues (10%) to the platform if the writer decided to charge at all. \\n\\nMost importantly, the entrepreneurs emphasized this new platform would empower writers. It would not be a new social aggregator standing in the way between author and audience. The platform would not own the subscribers. The writer would. And she could take them with her if she decided to leave. \\n\\nThis offer was generally appealing. The design was good. It was easy to use. They attracted a number of writers around various topics and communities. A number of these writer’s soon attracted a decent number of loyal subscribers. But revenues remained pretty small despite momentum and the costs of development and operations were not insignificant. The platform needed capital to grow.\\n\\nBut here’s where the stream of time split from our reality. (Cue spooky sci-fi sound effects.) Because in *this* other dimension, the platform entrepreneurs didn’t raise venture money. Maybe this was because they couldn’t. Maybe VCs didn’t want to invest in yet another media tech play. Or maybe it was because the entrepreneurs didn’t want to. \\n\\nInstead, they decided to raise capital by selling crypto tokens directly to the Substack subscriber community. To make them worth buying, all subscriptions and payments were moved on-chain so that the tokens could provide their owners a number of utility benefits. First, they could be used as a way of pre-paying for newsletters in advance (support). Second, they might be associated with some profit-sharing once the platform started earning money. And lastly, the tokens would be used for governance purposes, for votes on the future strategy of the platform project itself. In essence, the platform, Substack, had become a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.\\n\\nOur other-dimension Substack team granted themselves some amount of the tokens, and perhaps under pressure, they granted some to their writers based on some formula of subscribers and/or revenues. Then, the big moment, they let Substack subscribers know they were available for purchase.  \\n\\nThe token sale was a success! Loyal participants, encouraged by their favorite newsletter-authors, jumped at the chance to get more deeply involved in Substack. Some of the top writers even bought more tokens themselves, using their earnings to increase their position. The price of the token quickly went up, and even people who had not yet known about the project piled in. \\n\\n**Substack, the Lender**\\n\\nAs the platform began to scale, much like in our own timeline, the project faced a big challenge. A lot of the platform’s most desirable writers, writers who could almost certainly attract a ton of paying subscribers, were currently paid employees of media companies. For them to leave those jobs and come to a platform where they were paid by subscribers meant taking a risk, and for some amount of time at least, perhaps a severe pay cut. \\n\\nThen, one day in the Substack discord, somebody had an idea; What if the project used the funds they just had raised to not only pay for tech and ops, but to offer some very popular writers a guarantee for the first year? It would be a bit of a gamble. These mainstream media writers’ might not be successful on the platform. But the proposal’s proponents argued that the project had no choice but to try it. The alternative would be to just wait for the slower growth of independent less well-known writers.\\n\\nIt was the community’s first big vote -- and it passed by a large majority. A long list of columnists and journalists had been approved for invitation to the guarantee program. To nobody’s surprise, most of these ignored or declined the offer. But some of the invited writers agreed. Still others requested a larger sum, forcing Substack to work out a kind of negotiation model where token-holders approved this new amount. Within a few months, some very big names were writing on the platform.\\n\\nTo the surprise of even the staunchest guarantee program advocates, the results were amazing. Many of the invited authors gained more subscribers than anticipated, easily outperforming expectations. In fact, most of the most popular writers on the platform were now guarantee recipients. \\n\\nThere was only one issue; as was the case in our reality, when the Substack community looked at exactly which of the guarantee writers were performing best, it turned out there was a pattern. A meaningful percentage of their top performers, whether from the left-wing or right, were those self-described as ‘anti-woke.’ As the business model is to subscribe to an individual, the relationship became less just about the content the person created and more about the position the person took. A new business of Opinions. \\n\\nIn retrospect, this should have been at least somewhat obvious. Who was more likely to take the leap from a ‘mainstream’ publication? Someone who was critical of what he, she, or they considered a ‘stultifying newsroom orthodoxy.’ Who might attract plenty of paying subscribers? Someone who provided news and views for the engaged audience who hated those allegedly repressive newsrooms. \\n\\nThe implications of this were challenging to say the least. Even though Substack did not promote their guaranteed or most popular newsletters, it seemed inevitable that these writers would come to represent the project overall. What if the association made it harder to attract readers and writers of other perspectives? What if alternative newsletter platforms seized the opportunity to steal away writers and this competition caused the token’s value began to fall? What if supporting these writers was simply wrong.\\n\\nSoon enough, Substack’s owner-community began raising the issue. They organized into three factions. There was the group of people who felt that the current program was working fine. They should continue to offer guarantees to well-known writers and whoever was successful. The second group argued that the guarantee program, for all of its success, had at the very least become too damaging to the brand of the project, and should be discontinued. If these ‘anti-woke’ writers continue to use the platform, fine, but any perception of editorial endorsement should be eliminated. The final group thought Substack should recognize that the biggest opportunity was to help develop writers that would reach underrepresented communities. By making a special effort to reach out to and even subsidize promising contributors before they were famous, they could expand the brand and the platform. These folks also felt that especially toxic writers should be banned from using the Substack platform.\\n\\nThe debate raged. There was much discordance. The project team, the readers, even those who only owned the token as an investment, all weighed in. The writers were loudest of all, rallying their followers across social media. You can probably guess which of Substack’s naturally (and professionally) argumentative pundits fell into which camp. And in some cases you’d be right. But interestingly, the debate became more complicated than that. Many of the most popular ‘anti-wokeists’ now had a lot of potential wealth tied up in Substack tokens. Some of them recognized that having the brand over-associated with one political stance, and especially with really notorious trolls, was potentially a huge drag on their value. Several of these writers came out in favor of expanding subsidies to female, POC, LGBTQ, and other underrepresented writers. Meanwhile, some of those opposed to the ‘anti-wokeists,’ despite the momentum of their position, decided to leave anyway, starting their own competitive DAO. \\n\\n**The Difference Between Substack and DAOstack**\\n\\nSo how did these two timelines differ? In many ways, they didn’t. The platform’s features were pretty much the same. The people who were popular here were popular there. The dynamic which seems to especially infect our opinion pages was just as salient in the other dimension.\\n\\nBut there were some subtle differences. The positions of the writers, who really are at the heart of the current debate, were not simply tweets or quotes in a Ben Smith column, not just the views of disgruntled or delighted customers. In the alternative Substack world, they were the opinions of owners seeking to influence other owners. Everyone involved recognized that the value of their tokens was directly connected to the decisions the community would make, and the high value that would result from finding a solution that would be most appealing to readers and writers.\\n\\nAnd in the case where the community found that solution, the DAOstack perhaps built a thriving ecosystem. As co-owners, readers actively recommended newsletters to their family and friends. The token soared in value, and the treasury became the largest single source of funding for independent journalism and opinion. Excess funds were invested in other tokens for growth and diversification, a kind of endowment. Standing committees were created to select writers who would cover underfunded subjects and communities, which introduced other possible models for book publishing and local journalism.  If a writer was not offered a grant by one of the standing committees, any token-holder or group of holders could still independently decide to provide funding. Over time, these independently originated guarantees became the majority of loans to new writers. \\n\\nBut what if our two timelines collided? What if, as happens from time to time in multiverses, these two dimensions became one, and Substack Inc and DAOstack both existed in the same place and time? [Alien vs. Predator?Adam Warlock vs. Magus?](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Magus_(Earth-7528)) Who would win and why?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1e2cbd81-d616-44a6-b23a-0c5e81a95236.png?height=936\\u0026width=614)\\n\\n**The Final Battle.**\\n\\nOne way to think about this is to compare how successful the two institutions would be as lenders. To oversimplify, lenders compete on three aspects: who can source the most and most promising borrowers; who can price a loan most accurately -- ie., determine how much capital and at what rate to give to ensure the most lucrative return; and who can acquire capital most inexpensively. In other words, you want to amass money at the lowest price, and give the right amount at the right price to the most people. \\n\\nThere’s no reason Substack Inc. couldn’t become an excellent scale lender for all sorts of paid media projects. But DAOStack might have some unique competitive advantages. \\n\\nFor writers and other creators, a project owned by writers and readers is a potentially appealing partner. Like Vanguard in mutual funds or non-profits who run hospitals, there’s real brand benefit that comes from being perceived as a natural ally. Maybe you’re slightly more likely to believe they are ‘on your side.’ And, socially, the fact some of your existing readers and fellow writers are likely to be DAOstack owners, makes it more likely that you’ll hear about the offer in positive terms. After all, they have a vested interest in promoting it to you.\\n\\nDetermining who represents a good investment and how much to stake them is a trickier, more technical capability. Presumably, over time, both Substack Inc. and DAOStack would employ algorithms that analyzed the writer’s follower base, their writing history, and the appeal of their topical focus. Maybe one would be better at this. Maybe they’d be evenly matched. In any case, it’s likely that both would continue to use human judgment, overriding the ‘computer’ when a writer felt like a good risk, or an important one, anyway. Which would be better at this? Substack Inc. would not suffer from the raucous arguments of the token-holder committees, and could perhaps allocate capital more efficiently. DAOStack’s independent token-holders and market model might be more successful in identifying smaller unexpected winners. \\n\\nPerhaps the DAO’s biggest advantage would be the amount of capital it could quickly accumulate.  When combined with an enthusiastic community of investors, the frictionless nature of DeFi enables capital formation at hyperspeed. It is hard to imagine that a centralized venture-backed company could match these abilities. \\n\\nHere in our dimension, we are in the midst of a wave of venture investing in the creator economy. Companies building new platforms for writers, artists, and other makers are closing huge rounds from A-list investors. These investments are driving much-needed product innovation. Even more importantly, they are increasingly providing the financial subsidies necessary to transition people from employment to independence. But these platforms depend on brilliant creators, and they depend on the users who are loyal to them. Without their buy-in, none of it works, at least, not for long. It’s quite possible that the decentralized ownership model enabled by DAOs and DeFi can perform as well or better as the venture one, while providing those stakeholders with a seat at the decision-making table and a piece of the pie. Why not an OnlyFans owned by the performers? Why not a Clubhouse governed by the influencers?\\n\\nDecentralization doesn’t eliminate the hard problems. It doesn’t wish away wars over values; hierarchies of professional vs amateur; the challenges of developing and nurturing talent. And, token-based governance isn’t necessarily going to reach the best or most ethical solutions. But the participatory purpose of a DAO makes the debates around these issues transparent. They make them a matter for the community. Instead of having ‘management’ struggle to accommodate different constituencies, the costs/benefits tradeoffs are born by the community directly and managed by the community itself. DeFi, by reducing the transaction costs and creating the infrastructure needed to operate such a system finally enables true community-run organizations.\\n\\nOur colliding Substacks both bring value to their communities. Both can serve as an evolution to transition into a world when you can have both financial support, creator capital, and a collective-based media platform. As we move from a purely brand-led to a talent-led media ecosystem, the venture model should evolve to encourage both the talent and its community to be owners and drivers of the experience. \\n\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"dXLsgFCPeKnOQg-81N9uaHUsvdlkAsKSGXZM5ed4UIM\",\"timestamp\":1618935259,\"title\":\"Substack vs. DAOstack\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs\",\"body\":\"![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590286162167-70fb467846ae?ixid=mxwxmja3fdb8mhxwag90by1wywdlfhx8fgvufdb8fhw%3d\\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1\\u0026auto=format\\u0026fit=crop\\u0026w=1350\\u0026q=80)\\n\\n\\n\\n*In 2018, [I wrote an article for Token Daily](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/reputation-in-web-3) on the web's reputation systems. Three years later, we've hit many of the milestones. Below is an update to the original version that includes some recent advancements.*\\n\\nReputation, on the Internet, has been warped. We’ve built an information system that rewards recency and relevancy mechanics, with an aim more towards discoverability than integrity. It has become a competition to generate results for result’s sake. We’ve strayed away from the efforts that make something truly reputable and instead over-indexed on the end result, generalizing how we value information on the web today. It doesn’t matter what you put into it as long as what comes out matches the criteria for success. And that’s wrong.\\n\\nThere’s a very simple reason for this behavior: we don’t know what the systems to derive reputation look like on a global scale. It’s not quantifiable, and at a baseline isn’t a definition that is mutually agreed upon by all. Filtering this much content on the web, even in groups powered by large computing systems, is too influenced by outside sociological and political pressures. This filtering pushes towards filter bubbles and separates in an effort to integrate. Not to mention, outside incentives are hindering our ability to deliver anything of absolute true value.\\n\\nTo create stronger reputation signals in this newest iteration of the web, we’re going to need to build off of the benefits of the previous versions of the web and leverage the coordination abilities that come from an uncensorable, highly available, and ubiquitous database. We need to align technology with the ethics and value we as a society hold dear. This, of course, leads us to a blockchain powered by an incentive system that rewards participation and holds accountability through immutability.\\n\\n*So let’s start from the beginning.*\\n\\n**Democratized**\\n\\nIn the first attempt to build out the web, we didn’t have a set way to determine and identify what was reputable or established. The web itself was in its infancy and wasn’t structured to maintain the responsibility it eventually held as becoming the technical system for society. What we found out very quickly was that this system enabled all humans to express themselves freely and openly in a way that not only made them unique, but made them connected to the rest of the world. The web became a society of information.\\n\\nDirectories were the first way to sort all of this information through some reasonably well-defined hierarchy. We started grouping websites together as “web rings” to trade traffic with one another; once you identified a good site, you could expect similar quality from the other participants within the ring. Search engines built giant computing engines in order to index all of the information, created the first filtering algorithms, and made it easy to actively find things we expressed intent on learning about based on how many times the content was referenced on other websites.\\n\\nParticipating in the first web was open and democratized, but there was some significant issues. Filtering all of that information in a way to help quality content surface to the top was extremely problematic. Search engine optimization (SEO) became a game that had extremely high rewards for those who could land themselves in the top results for high volume keywords. To become good at finding the results that mattered to you, you had to learn boolean algebra. Collecting and crawling all of the websites as the primary way to capture information can leave some content behind. If the author wasn’t well-versed at the black magic that is SEO, there’s a chance that their content might not be indexed correctly which could create an artificial censorship. Of course, some of the companies that built search engines aren’t even allowed to serve results in certain countries which has created a very real censorship issue. Searching is a very active process and doesn’t help us passively find content that might be relevant to our needs. Directories did a good job at categorizing content to ”surf through”, but that still took hours of work sometimes to find what you were looking for if you weren’t exactly sure on how to describe it.\\n\\n**Web 1.0** didn’t create a strong way to expose reputable content, but it completely democratized content creation, distribution, and monetization. For a first attempt, we made something that forever impacted how every human in the world receives information. The next leap was distribution.\\n\\n**Distributed**\\n\\n**Web 2.0** was all about your content living where the users were. We developed these new platforms with engagements such as likes, retweets, and upvotes as the next way to build reputation signals for content. Each action created a public signal that could be used to help personalize content that could now be delivered to users on the platforms passively because we knew what was popular within each other’s social groups without requiring intent to give meaningful results.\\n\\nPlatforms from Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter accelerated the standardization of making an Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) available which created a more distributed way to access content instead of relying on search and created massive ecosystems of developers expanding their reach. However, your content would no longer just live on your website or blog, but it now had to be modified to fit the platforms in which it was hosted on. As of July 2018, there are at least 20 social platforms with more than 200 million users. For someone tasked with delivering information, it was critical understand how information moved and how best to deliver it across technical borders. Each platform had a separate algorithm and list of “success” criteria, creating far more complexity than SEO.\\n\\nThe goal was to strike up relevant conversations and share interesting topics with each other, but instead we all became acutely aware of how our actions represented our reputation, honesty and accountability. Although we had more ways to access content than we ever had with completely centralized platforms, we concentrated effort towards a handful of platforms that had mastered distribution which [something] power again to a small handful of platforms. The products weren’t just the platforms anymore; the products had become the publishers and the source for reputation on the web. Naturally, most users started manipulating the algorithms to paint the picture they wanted seen, not what was really happening or was important. We started valuing our efforts by quantifying it in the likes, retweets and comments our content captured and again gaming the underlying systems that powered reputation.\\n\\nWeb 2.0 gave us a whole new lens to start looking at content through and our relationships between each other became an integral part of how we consumed information. No longer did we have to seek out information, but instead we created an issue where we had too much coming at us at all times. We trusted our friends, but not the sources our friends used, which created a significant difficulty in determining the reputation of content. Social signals didn’t tell the whole truth about the reputation of content, but did again provided a profound new way to connect all of the people on earth.\\n\\n**Decentralized**\\n\\nMisinformation is more present and accessible than ever, and “truth” and “trust” are no longer objective in the eyes of all consumers. This is where we need to play in what I call “the gray”. How can we build a system that is impartial, not necessarily pushing people towards a black or white but rather exposing information in the gray? To do that, we need a decentralized record of information and an incentive system to build towards a common goal for the network, by the network. The next wave of the web is truly about reputation, and not only what is recent and relevant.\\n\\nThe next web of reputation systems is starting to develop and all signs point to blockchain technologies being the foundation. We are now able to deliver information that’s easily curated but uncensorable. We’re working with data sets and information that is ubiquitous but not overwhelming. The bridge to this web is connecting content with accountability through immutability and reputation. This participation and ownership will push towards a new culture, and not succumb to the vanity that unearthed in the distribution phase. We’re making the web free again.\\n\\nTogether, we’re building the foundation for a verifiable web, a place where we can construct the next generation of technologies that highlight the value of the individual. This is what makes reputation in this era different; it’s about the individual, the efforts that go into a given action and integrating systems to measure that. It’s not about the platforms where information is distributed or the channels where it is found, it is about the individual sender and the value tied to their efforts.\\n\\nBecause of this, the next chapter of reputation will flip from “reputation of platform and publisher” to “reputation of individual.” The source of reputation is no longer with the platform where the creator resides but tethered to the creator itself. Consumers, observers and owners are becoming more creator specific; there is less trust in the platforms and distribution mechanisms and more on the messengers that deliver. Through decentralization, we’re able to build systems that enable these messengers to separate dependency from platforms for audience, revenue and growth. It opens a new economy where reputation is aligned directly with the creator.\\n\\nCurrently, there have been platforms that enable coordination and allocation of intrinsic or extrinsic “capital” to achieve shared goal. With blockchain-based networks, we want to incentivize participants towards some predictable outcome that is beneficial for every network participant. It’s not just about the group, but also about the network participant themself.\\n\\nWhat’s most exciting about this next era of permissionless innovation is that it’s not longer dependent on a central authority. It’s not dependent on host, network, publisher or platform. This era of reputation is not built and dictated by a set standard of link share clubs or opaque algorithms. It’s adjustable, adaptable, managed and maintained by your preferences. We no longer need to be strictly driven by how a single platform categorizes, aggregates, and rewards. We can rely on each other to index this information now in a way that benefits all of the participants.\\n\\nIt is important that we understand the values of this new era of permissionless systems as they pertain to the individual. The biggest value that this brings, and what separates it from prior mechanics in democratized and distributed systems is the opportunity of interoperability. This new era means that all the work someone puts within a single network can now be collected and used beyond that network. Interoperable reputation in the decentralized era is the freedom to leverage what you’ve built beyond restrictive borders. As an example, let’s look at the media landscape:\\n\\nIn media, the main driver for revenue is both subscriptions and advertising. These two means fund the growth of media on the web and are platform specific. That means, when someone subscribes or advertises to something, they do so on the platform rather than the individual. The platform holds the reputation, and the individual leverages the platform to build their own audience and value. An example is the writer relationship to the Washington Post, the photographer’s relationship to Getty Images or a musicians relationship to Spotify. There are many. These reputation based systems are prominent in democratized and distributed eras but begin to fail in the decentralized phase. This is a good thing. Here’s how it works:\\n\\nThe current: The value and ways of driving revenue for creators through advertising and subscriptions are currently platform specific, even though they are all driven by wanting to own a message directly. The reputation is tied to the platform as dictated by the democratized and distributed web. In this era of reputation (decentralized) this balance shifts.\\n\\nThe shift: The creator’s reputation is now the value. It's no longer about advertising or transacting with the NYT or Spotify or Getty directly. It’s about transacting with that creator wherever that creator is. This is doable now because reputation is aligned with the individual itself.\\n\\nThe result: a monolithic shift in the opportunity for creators and the restraints of the companies that are currently working as hard as possible to best represent them. It’s no longer a forfeiture of reputation to centralized systems, it’s taking ownership and allowance of your own value, your own reputation. In this case, the reputation is now on the individual, not the platform or the grantor; you, and your work are what is reputable and that carries throughout the entire web ecosystem, regardless of the platform it lives on.\\n\\nThis shift towards individuality as a driver of reputation in the decentralized era is exactly what will drive everyone towards a better web. Each stage has shown a both progress and digress in where we aim to go and how far we still have to go to get there. With this next step towards reputation, individuals are now empowered by the commitment to the openness of ecosystem and the network of builders, verifiers and maintainers of a healthy and newfound ecosystem. There will no doubt be short falls, but investing in building networks that account for interoperability, freedom and openness move us closer to a web where we can find better information, better knowledge and better trust. This is the future of a reputable web. The web of the individual.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"WaWofVz9ekmQ6UyOVgovQFtg1mRbnA1aYfaFy1oPcVs\",\"timestamp\":1617472185,\"title\":\"Reputation in Web3\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY\",\"body\":\"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/743d74ad-f82c-494f-be3d-d6aa40409420.jpeg?height=194\\u0026width=450)\\n\\nImagine this… \\n\\nDark Star, a publication, produces articles. Those articles can be purchased as NFTs, at any point in the ideation -\\u003e writing -\\u003e editing -\\u003e published lifecycle. There are two tiers of access to those articles: As a ‘Reader,’ for $10 bucks a month, I get to read all of the published articles. But as an ‘Investor,’ for $20 bucks a month, I get a share in the sale of the NFTs. As an investor, you have transparency as to what is being created and what the benefits are as a token holder of that NFT. \\n\\nCan you see that future?\\n\\nOver the past few years, as subscriptions have made a comeback, media companies have spent about 90% of their resources towards building and maintaining subscription models around content and about 10% experimenting with tools and features that provide benefits to their subscribers.\\n\\nThe majority of thinking for expanding value for subscribers is to expand verticals, coverage and genre. When actually, the subscriber is most interested in the particular voice, often niche, that the publisher provides. Scale is no longer horizontal, it’s vertical, and value is found in the depths of niche vs. the expansion of topics. The opportunity for content expansion is less about hiring, acquiring and monetizing a new topic and more about collaboration with creators and media companies that are already trusted in that topic. But that’s for another essay. \\n\\nInstead of focusing so heavily on content expansion, creators and publishers need to be thinking about building features they can provide their most loyal customers-- the subscriber. The goal should be to have subscribers identify directly with the creator and feel invested in their work. They should feel value in the environment the creator is building outside of the content itself, through community, collaboration and participation. These features and tools should enable that, which makes loyalty and retention as a functioning utility vs. a sentiment. \\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1371535000336793603)\\n\\nThere are a ton of ways to do this, the most popular is tiered membership for subscribers based on how much and how often they pay. Premium subscription tiers aren’t new, in fact, most legacy publications leverage this. But the problem is, 90% of the value is tied to more content. On new platforms like Substack, they take it a step further with subscription tier options tied to the content \\u0026 the creator relationship; pay monthly for content, pay annually for content, pay $XXXX for a mystery tier. Now these mystery tiers or founding tiers as some call them, are often unknown, but the assumption is that creators will provide subscribers with products outside of the content itself that bring value and new benefits. This can include community products on discord, exclusive access to Q\\u0026As, a direct line to the creator... basically, similar to what The Information does today. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9974e800-f35b-4a5c-8012-81c6bfc2d464.jpeg?height=230\\u0026width=537)\\n\\nBut what's amazing with Substack that's under discussed is that subscribers actually do feel like they're investing in creator success. They subscribe for the content but also because they want that creator to continue doing what they do. There's just no financial association with that success.\\n\\n[I wrote an article](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI) a few weeks ago about how media companies could think about evolving to an ownership structure--\\n\\n“This new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside.”\\n\\nMirror, the platform that this article is published on, is implementing this structure for writers today. [John Palmer pioneered this model when he launched his $ESSAY project](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0) last month and on Sunday, [Mario Gabriele and Jack Butcher launched the crowdfund of their project $GENERALIST](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/generalist-token). The details of this model are described and executed in both of their projects, as it relates to the creators, the crowdfund and the community as investors. Taking it a step further, I see this as an evolutionary model to the media's subscription business. \\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele/status/1371273870334947328)\\n\\nToday, as seen through John, Mario and Jack’s work, these are project based. The creator crowdfund's for the project, in return they give the community members $tokens. The project, once completed, is minted to an NFT and then all $token holders get a fixed percentage of the total amount the NFT sold for. In the scenario dreamt up above, this moves from project based to publication based.

But as we move towards a world that is more creator direct, subscribers should have the opportunity to literally invest in their favorite creators and share upside in their success. As seen above, it’s already happening today, so we’re not too far off from this reality. \\n\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nthx to [Jonathan Glick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) for his eyes on this piece.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"8p0qPpLDPNkV6Bb4ObfSCdR2PKAN0Gz9tWTnGq7ikRY\",\"timestamp\":1615925571,\"title\":\"A Media Ownership Model: Why Subscribe When You Can Invest?\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\",\"body\":\"\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/22000/1\\\\*WSU7jClH_cq0BWV4GQnVDA.jpeg)\\n\\n[Florian Klauer](https://unsplash.com/@florianklauer?utm_source=unsplash\\\\\\u0026utm_medium=referral\\\\\\u0026utm_content=creditCopyText)\\n\\n[In my last piece](https://medium.com/@jarroddicker/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b), I proposed that the media companies of tomorrow should look like the record labels of today. In the music industry, talent is the driving force behind its business. Talent is the source of the reputation and the end of the line when it comes to driving financial returns. Without world-class talent creating great products, it doesn’t matter how well you promote or polish it — the results will be the same.\\n\\nThe “monetize the individual” disruption in media serves as an opportunity for business reinvention of companies who choose to recognize and react to this newly acknowledged trend forming. It’s not just about enabling and liberating talent, but more importantly about maintaining, supporting and growing that individual’s business better than they’re able to do on their own or elsewhere. The future media business will extend to newfound territory that fortunately for them, is right in its wheelhouse: Talent Management (Artists and Repertoire A\\\\\\u0026R).\\n\\nNow if media companies are record labels then[ journalists are rock stars](https://breakermag.com/po-et-ceo-jarrod-dicker-wants-to-turn-journalists-into-rock-stars/). And while media companies spend time working to restructure and focus their business on talent and become “the label”, we’ll see a lot of individuals exit the major “labels” and go independent. These creators will then structure themselves as independent media companies and develop micro labels themselves.\\n\\nAs these media companies and platforms start to become venues for creator operations and development, the individual’s brand becomes a business of its own. The journey someone takes to build their business is completely uncharted and adapts natively to their specific needs. That’s because this new world is one won by Janes of all trade. It encourages experiential nuance \\u0026 a ‘build the plane while you’re flying it’ approach to entrepreneurship. What’s most often discussed are [individuals who leave a media company to go and build a brand of their own](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/24/substack-email-newsletter-journalism/). Their background is usually as a writer, designer, editor and they carry their individual reputation from a known publication or Twitter to their new independent business.\\n\\nBut the opposite is also happening; [entrepreneurial minds who have built businesses at established companies or on their own are also choosing a path to become creators themselves](https://digiday.com/media/how-substack-has-spawned-a-new-class-of-newsletter-entrepreneurs/). So unlike those who have built a career in media or journalism and now decide to become entrepreneurs, there are those who have built a career in business or tech and now decide to become journalists.\\n\\nT**his is what I’m calling the** **age of the** **Renaissance Creator **— the hybridization of the individual as both a creator and an entrepreneur. This development and definition of ‘creativity’ is one of the more interesting things happening today because it is contrary to the *supposed *logic for a creator to go independent. We like to say independence (see: [passion economy](https://li-jin.co/2019/10/22/the-passion-economy-and-the-future-of-work/)) is valuable because it lets a creator focus on what they do best; create. But actually it’s the opposite. By going independent, the creator is aspiring to not only create, but willingly assume the [management and business of their entire self](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1283426952909672450?s=20). This acceptance of responsibility as a formula for success will dictate a creator’s desire to go independent and develop a micro-label or decide to limit duties and create within a larger media organization.\\n\\n*I want to be a creator. I want to be a business. I want to be a brand.*\\n\\nPlatforms have made it more achievable than ever to gain experience vertically within specific categories and port that individual’s reputation horizontally from one network to another. Because of this, all aspiring creators now compete on the same playing field. Each platform is a building block for the individual’s brand and affords them clout and entry into another platform. We’re seeing this happen in real-time across media, with journalists leaving large umbrella media companies to go independent, finding a home to build their core business \\u0026 then extend the reputation of that business to further monetize their own brand, and create their own label.\\n\\n***Newsletters are mixtapes.***\\n\\nThe independent writer business is not new. It’s an evolution from blogging that has now found a home through newsletter platforms like Substack that enable anyone, from any background, the ability to build their own label. If you can write, build an audience \\u0026 manage distribution, you are now a media company. And that transition from creating to becoming an entrepreneur (building an audience, managing distribution) is a phenomenon that’s insanely exciting but also really hard. Platforms like Twitter make this audience building and portability easier, but that’s more attainable on the journalist to entrepreneur track vs. the entrepreneur to journalist track. It’s also evolved the idea of journalism and has invited many unconventional backgrounds of writers into the journalism business.\\n\\nThere is a rally cry from traditional news organizations and media outlets who say “these aren’t journalists!” or “these aren’t media companies!”. Much like a major label wouldn’t consider an indie label competition until it takes their business, the same situation is unraveling in the new creator economy: journalists and writers are leaving institutions to try and build the next evolution of the media business on their own. As larger media companies become labels, their value to the creator needs to supplement the value the creator can attain on their own. In the era of the Renaissance Creator, all definitions are reconsidered. All businesses are reinvented.\\n\\nIf independent writers are like independent artists, newsletters are an entry into the media business like mixtapes are an entry into the music business. That’s because newsletters offer a medium of creation that has no barrier to entry and no production costs other than the willingness for the person to enter the ring and write. The business, the audience, the words, the design, the distribution…EVERYTHING is on the individual to learn, adapt and build on their own. This ownership of responsibility driving the hybridization of the individual is why we’re seeing such a unique mix of creators and journalists taking different paths to becoming stars. But now instead of grabbing a rapper’s CD from the spin rack at an Exxon/Mobil, you’re putting your email in a sign up box and it’s being delivered directly to you.\\n\\nAnd like mixtapes, the newsletter relationship is creating a cult-like following for the creator, turning readers into fans. The fan comes along for the ride as the writer moves from amateur status to stardom and it introduces a relationship with the creator that’s personal. This opens up a ton of opportunities for emerging businesses and, visibly, a possible transition for creator’s as they exit the passion economy and move towards the [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/). When fans are invested in a creator’s success, the economics change for both the creator and the consumer.\\n\\n***A new value on content***\\n\\nThere’s a bizarre connection between what newsletters did for content and what streaming did for music that is worth paying attention to. In today’s media business, content’s value is, well, often valueless. The fuel of the information ecosystem is “breaking news” which is usually released by a larger publication and then runs through the creator lifecycle of syndication, curation, aggregation and then resuscitation. That information is most valuable when it “breaks”, then when there’s commentary on the curation and then it’s worth is dictated by programmatic level CPMs until it fizzles. This has encouraged consumers to believe that content should be free, or at least at some time, available for consumption at no cost.\\n\\nBut this isn’t the same with newsletters. Newsletters have put tangible value on a creator’s work that has allowed them to build a business around both their individual brand and the content that they create. It is both a platform *and *a format. It’s enabled the creator to deliver thoughtful analysis with a consistent point of view. It’s allowed them to create a “micro label” business outside of the management of larger holding companies. It’s valuable.\\n\\n*Let’s compare***: **Readers assume content is free. Music *became* free. Napster wasn’t about making music free as much as it was about user experience and user control. Listeners demanded a better experience and Napster was the catalyst for that. Newsletters, and curation are similar. Out of Napster came streaming. With a new user experience and ability to give listeners control of what they wanted to listen to, they not only stopped stealing music but they started paying for it. The product valued music by the listeners on a level that was lost with the introduction of Napster and earned back again through experience.\\n\\nPrior to this newsletter boom, readers have been doing anything possible to circumvent the payment experience. Again, this isn’t about paying for content but more so about needing control, needing a better experience and thus the casualty of that desire is media companies losing revenue (ad blockers and circumventing paywalls). But what’s incredible with newsletters is, people aren’t looking for ways to steal content. In fact, content is more portable than ever (I forward this email to you) but it’s not being done because the experience and control is finally made available to that particular reader. So much so, that they’re even starting to pay for it.\\n\\nCuration is so similar to playlists — people *steal* content because they don’t want to pay for a bundle subscription in order to read a single article just like people were stealing music because they didn’t want to buy a CD to listen to a single song. New formats breed new models and people value choice. Before streaming, creating custom playlists were difficult and piracy allowed users to curate their own experience. Before newsletters, creating personalized content feeds were difficult but now you, the reader, are able to create your own bundles.\\n\\nAs you can see, not only has this format enabled any creator to enter the venue and launch a media company, but it’s also enabled a new way of thinking of putting value on the creator work which then breeds new business models tied to ownership, consumer relationship (ie. customers are fans) and beyond.\\n\\n***A new value on creator***\\n\\nOptions create value, and what we’re seeing in the creator economy is a recalibration of not just the product that’s produced, but the producers themselves. Traditionally, creators who worked within media organizations were undervalued simply because the reputation is on the company itself. All individuals within the organization contribute to building the business and reputation of the larger holding company, which means individual reputation contribution is difficult to calculate and put value on. It took the Economist 176 years to *finally *[add bylines to some of their content pages](https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-economist-adds-bylines-to-blogs/). The *holy shit! *moment of creator’s realizing that their value \\\\*could\\\\* be larger than it’s getting credit for started with platforms and the ability to accumulate and engage followers directly on platforms. But the emergence of platforms like Substack, OnlyFans, Cameo \\u0026 Patreon have accelerated that and are creating a new market indicator for individuals similar to what free agency does to athletes.\\n\\nLet’s use the NFL as an example. Not every quarterback in the NFL is valued the same because they’re a quarterback in the NFL. There is an open marketplace, free-agency, that leverages a community and auction process to assess the value of a player based on many factors. Before the enablement of creator’s to operate their own businesses in the passion economy, all creator value under the umbrella of a media organization was generalized or, oftentimes, devalued. It seems obvious that all creators are different, like QBs are, yet we value them the same because there has never been a marketplace or venue for the community/readers to openly bid, purchase and set the value of the creator’s work. In this new environment, creator’s take a step further than the QB in that they are now actually in a free-market. Anyone has a shot. Anyone can demand value.\\n\\nWhat we’re seeing with the emergence of these platforms and adoption by creators is the venue for a market dictating ‘value per individual’ creator. Using Substack for example, each writer can set their own price, product \\u0026 expand membership products and benefits any which way. It’s dictated by the creator and the consumer decides whether or not they think it’s valuable. If they agree, the value is set. Before Substack, if an individual writer wrote for a publication, they had no idea what their ‘value per individual’ was. They knew their traffic, or their following on platforms outside of that publication, but internally their value was diluted amongst others.\\n\\nWhat platforms in the passion economy bring is a direct value attribution by the fans to creators that’s dictated by all market factors (competition, content, platform, budget). [As I argued in my last piece](https://medium.com/@jarroddicker/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b), these are benefits that larger media companies need to adopt as the attraction of brand reputation is now second to their ability to be excellent distributors, developers and managers of talent and talent’s product.\\n\\nThese models result in more value for creators, a financial opportunity and business tied to independence and a true value reset on the contributors that make the creative economy run.\\n\\nIn the era of the Renaissance Creator, there are options. As media companies position themselves to put a bigger emphasis on the creator and transition their value proposition to include A\\\\\\u0026R and an opportunity for individuals to build their brand under the larger halo, individuals are entertaining the value of not only going solo but building micro labels themselves. This doesn’t just change the construct of how creators transact and engage with consumers but alters the actual structure of how the business itself is established. The business of the Renaissance Creator and its creation of micro labels may adopt the models of the major labels, iterate on existing business practices or create new ones entirely.\\n\\nA great example of this is around the announcement of The Defector. The team behind Deadspin just announced Tuesday that they’re launching a new media business, The Defector. It’s a 20 person media operation built on top of Pico, Stripe and Mailchimp. It is truly one of the first structured media Co-Ops in that each journalist owns their IP and owns, literally, about ~5% of the company. This means that if one journalist decides to leave, she can, the structure remains intact. This is one of the first examples of creators moving from the passion to the ownership economy, especially if business models begin acknowledging and rewarding participation from their customers.\\n\\nThis business is accelerating. [We’re seeing independent creators rebundle the unbundled newsroom and developing their own micro-labels anchored on platforms such as Substack](https://www.axios.com/substack-newsletters-journalism-media-5e4332d3-49a7-4f2a-9d95-a282b14b8202.html). We’re seeing creators teaming up and organizing themselves to build [collaboration groups ](https://2pml.com/2020/07/13/type-house/)to naturally support one another. We’ll start to see more products and companies focused on creator comfort (how can I be better at creating?) and confidence (how can I financially do this?) explode and surpass the value of the creative tools these individuals are building on.\\n\\nAnd as business models drive product strategy, we’ll see continued momentum move away from programmatic based advertising models and umbrella subscription efforts and towards an entirely new opportunity for monetization on top of the individual.\\n\\nThe new media economy will be built on a foundation of the very things that drive its value: the creator and the creator’s product\\n\\nRock and roll.\\n\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\",\"timestamp\":1615915833,\"title\":\"Media 2020: Rise of the Renaissance Creator and the Next Media Model\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\",\"body\":\"![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa31f9bc-c42a-48df-b557-67e3f53bc0ac_1536x2048.jpeg)\\n\\n*a [tweettal](https://twitter.com/tweettal), [jonathanglick](https://twitter.com/jonathanglick) \\u0026 [jarroddicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker) joint. remixed from [Trends, Analysis, Lies \\u0026 Statistics](https://tals.substack.com/p/nfts-need-an-audience).*\\n\\nThe places and ways to enjoy NFTs, especially for non-owners, essentially do not exist. While this is a problem, it makes sense. The breakthrough idea behind NFTs was that unique digital objects could be owned. So the initial set of applications were those directly involved in buying, selling, and storing. We needed marketplaces to shop and bid and wallets to pay with and hold our purchases. These are experiences that emphasize the private and personal nature of an NFT. But as with owned physical objects, this transactional aspect is only part of appreciating a possession. For any item with utility beyond immediate sustenance and safety, value is created socially. We understand its worth based on what the broader community thinks it’s worth. Right now, the community of people valuing NFTs is only the people making and buying them.  For a sense of scale, the [top 25 decentralized apps](https://dappradar.com/rankings) all together, not just those related to NFTs, probably had less than 250,000 transacting wallet/users over the last 24 hours, and nearly half of these were at Dapper’s Top Shots. For NFTs to reach their true potential, we need to build much farther-reaching consumption experiences. And to not repeat the same mistakes of our current digital era, we need these platforms to maintain a decentralized ethos.\\n\\nAs any asset begins to accrue greater recognition and deeper social significance, its value moves beyond being predominantly transactional and towards an expression of the owner’s identity. Its value transcends the actual product and comes to attribute worth to the owners themself. As this value is socialized, the community starts to not only associate the worth with the product but with the person too. *This is true in the physical world, where the identification with something you own is different from that of something you rent, lease, or borrow*. It is also true with NFTs. But, all of this won’t happen at scale without NFTs reaching and being adopted by the broader community.\\n\\nNFT creators and owners know this, of course. They want as many other people as possible to enjoy and contribute to their products and property. Owners want their possessions to be known, used, loved, and increasingly, remixed. The fact that non-owners can also consume NFT content doesn’t mean that owning them isn’t valuable. It’s the opposite. For example, if an NFT is minted for a particular moment, the more that moment is appreciated the more value the asset tied to that moment accrues. In fact, art owners have \\\\*always\\\\* benefited from public display and reproduction -- because appreciation of art/media/collectibles makes them more valuable, because widespread reproductions elevate the status of the “true” and original; and because widespread dissemination educates the market. This contributes to its culture. Reproducibility is a feature, not a bug. \\n\\nAs such, owners of NFTs have a vested interest in making sure that great third-party consumption experiences exist, especially if their ownership is evident and it can drive more transactions, passion, and engagement to the creator. Broader distribution will even drive new genres and creations built on top of the owned item, similar to hip-hop as a genre (a culture of remixing others’ originals) and the evolution of EDM by way of Dance music in Chicago to EDM in Europe. All of this remixing will make the originals more valuable. But this requires NFTs to be experienced in the first place. Only broad consumption will further the shift of NFTs from digital assets to cultural legacy. When we create awesome applications to share NFTs with this far broader group of people and let them consume them, and we will, the effects will be nothing short of [revolutionary](https://tals.substack.com/p/defi-creators-). \\n\\nUnfortunately, today, those great non-owner experiences barely exist. For art and collectible NFTs, the UX so far consists of marketplaces, social posts to promote sales, some data-driven transaction ranking sites, and crypto-wallets. We have the NFT equivalent of auction houses, media for pro art buyers, and the systems to manage transactions. All of it is geared to buyers or collectors and investors, for bidding and trading. These are not enjoyment-optimized environments. We’re missing the equivalent of museums, concert halls, theaters, and the fashion show that is just walking down the street. \\n\\nThe analogy should not be taken literally. Thanks to nascent ‘crypto worlds,’ there have been some admirable attempts to build three-dimensional museums and galleries. But unless you’re a real VR enthusiast, you probably haven’t been invited to or delighted by the experience. These spaces are inconvenient to navigate, oppressively skeuomorphic, and fail at the central goal of any NFT consumption app: connecting users instantly to the media they are most likely to enjoy. \\n\\nSo what *should* these experiences look like? Well, to start with, they probably aren’t that different from the UXes we currently use for exploring and consuming media on our phones and other screens. Whether you are visiting a site, marketplace, or chat application, NFTs should be integrated into the experience. Each application, based on its purpose, will have a different way of showcasing NFTs to consumers. If it was a player for NFT songs, it might let you listen or navigate by genre or most popular. Or like Zora.fm, just let you swipe to find stuff you liked, maybe getting algorithmically smarter about what you preferred, or letting you create an explicit interest profile. (More about that valuable and dangerous interest data later.) \\n\\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14184519-1e8b-41b0-b486-cfa660fcee07_864x852.png)\\n\\nBut there are also some essential differences about the consumption of NFTs and the needs of the NFT ownership ecosystem. The first is the fact that the owners of the media asset should be recognized. By giving the owner her own place of glory on the UX, we make them an important part of the creation story. This increases the value of ownership, which increases how much an artist can charge. Where we have traditionally lionized labels and studios and by extension the oligarchy of huge corporations that own them, we can instead salute the smaller entrepreneurial collector. And perhaps not only the current owner but the *first* owner, the one who took the initial risk to invest. It makes sense to be able to see what else they own, or have owned in the past, and be able to enjoy that also. Of course, owners might not necessarily be individuals. They can be groups of fans, buying clubs and collectives, perhaps [formalized in a DAO structure](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN\\\\_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI). This can change the way media companies and platforms structure their relationships with both creators and consumers under the value proposition of “ownership”. In this way, a DAO’s current and past media ownership functions both as a playlist and a sort of index fund. \\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030e604c-782d-4183-ab7f-9ac0e7e03b04\\\\_483x259.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030e604c-782d-4183-ab7f-9ac0e7e03b04\\\\_483x259.png)\\n\\nA second difference is the importance of linking to transaction opportunities, both the opportunity to bid on or buy that asset, as well as on related assets. Someone enjoying a comedy routine-NFT might want to bid on an NFT that is a collectible-ticket to the comedian’s upcoming show. This need not interfere with a delightful consumption experience. The app can be entirely optimized for the non-owner while also providing smooth paths to buying and collecting. One intriguing idea connecting both of these differences concerns an owner’s likely desire to more prominently promote an NFT they own, not unlike a featured post in a social media context. Instead of explicitly paying the app for that promotional presence, the owner might instead ‘stake’ the NFT, contributing the resulting revenues to the app. This could be a meaningful amount. As we have seen, highly-valued NFTs generate significant economic flows. \\n\\nThanks to the malleable nature of the NFT standard and the unbroken relationship to a creator, the consumption experience could offer features that today’s media apps do not. A song could have creator-supplied lyrics. Visual art could reveal its underlying layers. A dance routine could include a tutorial. Works could change over time, as programmable entities responding to external stimulus or the presence of other NFTs. Assets that are part of a multi-artist collections could link to the rest of that greater assembly, maybe to other items with similar attributes. Consumption experiences might also pull inspiration from gaming concepts. NFTs could ‘compete’ against each other in contests and tournaments: dance-offs, rap battles, song of the summer countdowns, jury-selected film awards. Prizes and promotion would flow back to the owners and creators. We will also see NFT displays designed for public places, restaurants, stores and clubs. Venues might even receive revenue from digital purchases when we once again gather in-person.  \\n\\nAs these apps are likely to offer personalization, driven by explicit or implicit interests or social graph, one important question is how user data should be managed. Some developers will opt to store the data on their own servers, the way Twitter, Facebook, Spotify and Tiktok do now. The performance benefits are significant, and it’s a huge competitive advantage. In the near term, apps that ‘own the user’ will be more convenient to access and more valuable to investors, partners and advertisers. The danger is that one of these apps uses that advantage to become so big that they cripple the NFT ownership economy. A dominant NFT-app might, for example, demand onerous percentages of transactions driven through its UX or push NFTs in which it had a large ownership stake. Some argue that this outcome is acceptable, provided that artists and owners themselves participate in the equity or revenues of the app through tokens, perhaps granted on the basis and extent of their participation. This may be short-sighted. The widespread adoption of decentralized identity systems, preventing no one app from dominating the last-mile of data ownership, is probably the best way of ensuring a competitive landscape in which artists and collectors get the best deal. Hopefully, prominent NFT creators and investors will loudly advocate for this practice.\\n\\nBut does it matter? What if, as might be expected, the current data-hoarding giants simply add NFTs into their own experiences? Or if they buy and integrate one of these new upstart apps? The dismal journey from the idealism of ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Web 2.0 to our current oligarchic Internet provides plenty of source material for pessimism. RSS was co-opted and killed by Google, then repackaged and controlled by Twitter and Facebook. Podcasting may be headed in the same direction. History rhymes and regulators tend to act too late and too clumsily to be a savior. The open question, and the spring of optimism if you choose to believe, is whether the new incentives of ownership have forever changed the equation. Do creators and owners, having tasted the fruits of independence, refuse to accept the ‘bad old’ deal? Do developers use the enormous power of the blockchain and DeFi to continue to fund and grow exciting and more equitable offerings? Do all of us consciously orient our media habits towards the ecosystems that most effectively promote broad creative prosperity? If we do, it won’t matter whether Instagram, Tiktok or Spotify becomes the most popular way to consume NFT content. Because to do so, those platforms will be forced to accept a culture of artist and collector control. Nothing is inevitable.\\n\\nThe NFT market is exploding upwards as speculators, builders, artists, promoters, and others see the opportunity to take advantage of the shift towards decentralized creation and distribution. At the same time, consumers are adopting the technology as they discover NFTs are [proof of passion](https://tals.substack.com/p/proof-of-passion), digitized tokens that prove commitment, interest, support thereby conferring status. But despite the eye-popping prices and insane growth, the market remains underdeveloped. It’s not surprising that people outside the collector cohort think the speculation is weird, and maybe even a little gross. We have yet to really build out how you consume, display and enjoy your collection as anything more than just storing it in your closet or vault or purchasing it on an exchange. *If NFTs crash and burn as a bubble, this will be why.* Only building for the consumption side will enable mass adoption, which will in turn support a loop of creation, ownership, consumption and creation that will power the next wave of media and social infrastructure. As these layers get built, there is an opportunity to avoid some of the centralized challenges of our current consumption and creation stacks and build a more creator-friendly, equitable future. But we have to choose to build it that way.\\n\\n/Credit to [Dennis Crowley](https://twitter.com/dens) for the header photo.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nhere's an NFT for you to own. shop local. \\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/25381014852418948805889093397553910691723421696921342528988486403015055507466)\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"bOWhYyX4u5mY0AfY-ObnQSOOcMVEmJQPVUFSw1qJsdc\",\"timestamp\":1615216368,\"title\":\"NFTs Need an Audience: Utility, Consumption and Building New Worlds\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\",\"body\":\"![](https://external-preview.redd.it/KRvJe99Df2drWk2SeW4BFGwDKkHz8KTk5q0G12saOQk.jpg?auto=webp\\u0026s=9cb8bd777f3aaad099efb4fcc6e08d3003455768)\\n\\n***a [jarroddicker](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker), [flynnjamm](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm) \\u0026 [patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera) joint***\\n\\nMedia companies are talent companies. As that becomes increasingly obvious to the media industry at large, there has been an acceleration of development by both challengers and incumbents to position themselves to capture media's most critical natural resource: people.\\n\\nThe creator economy served as a catalyst to disrupt legacy structures by introducing platforms \\u0026 products that enable individuals to build a business around themselves. There are many reasons why individuals want to go independent which I explain in detail here ([Media Companies as Record Labels](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b)) and here ([Rise of the Renaissance Creator](https://jarroddicker.medium.com/media-2020-rise-of-the-renaissance-creator-459daec4bc6b)), which introduce a variety of opportunities for both the talent and existing media institutions. The rapid development of platforms and services that empower individuals to build a business around themselves is a major one. Top talent wants more control and ownership over their work, having options to transcend their reputation and financial success from a parent brand.\\n\\nBut independence is really hard. The creator economy has invited criticism of creator burnout, lack of necessary support and an absence of strategic and educational resources for individuals to better guide themselves in isolation. While there is accelerated development in the creator economy to fulfill those needs, there’s another economy being built that is positioned to extend the promise of the new media structure even further.  \\n\\nThe ownership economy-- by way of decentralized autonomous organizations aka DAOs + non-fungible tokens aka NFTs-- builds a business on top of the creator economy that encourages creators, operators and the community to collaborate together under a new, interdependent ownership mechanism that combines the best of both (legacy + creator economy) worlds and then some.\\n\\nThis new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside. \\n\\nTo think of this pragmatically, let’s look at TV shows. Actors, actresses, producers and writers are free agents and sign deals for specific series on many platforms. Each series builds its own identity, reputation and community. The individuals that contribute to the show are free to work on other projects and may even be encouraged to in order to increase their own and the show's reputation (marketing!). This interoperability makes everything the individual touches more valuable. As I said in past posts, the new media structure starts to look more like record labels or in the example above, production studios, rather than traditional brand structures.\\n\\nSo back to creator DAOs and NFTs. The introduction of creator DAOs means that both the creators, its support, its contributors \\u0026 its audience are all owners in the collective. It means that every operation, and participants in the operation, are now shareholders. Today, creators can be owners in a media company by way of equity, but that’s often limited by the role each individual plays. As a result, once talented individuals build a strong enough reputation, they're incentivized to negotiate contracts or go independent to retain more ownership over their work. Media companies are starting to think about how they build a more welcome environment for those creators, but they’re developing in parallel to challenger structures like creator DAOs. DAOs present an alternative organizational structure that tries to align incentives for the long-term among a variety of stakeholders. The relationship changes from creator and consumer to everyone as co-creators. Creative organizations begin to look more like flat peer-to-peer networks as opposed to hierarchies. Everyone who contributes to the media company is a co-creator; the creator, support staff and community.\\n\\nThis is possible because the media company (collective) itself is a crowdfund of its creators, supporters and community members. All participators invest in the entity which results in a token, the “equity” of DAOs. All revenue across advertising, subscriptions, events and other means is then pooled to a treasury where all cash inflows and outflows are recorded publicly. There is a universal share in the ownership. \\n\\nWhere NFTs come in is that all digital assets created by the DAO are minted as NFTs. Through that, every asset becomes managed, monitored and owned. This means that creators, operators and participants are all collaborators on the NFT asset. Outside of pure ownership and participation, this means that an asset returns royalties based on the performance of the content, delivering returns for participants in perpetuity.\\n\\nWhat’s not often discussed, but is a real struggle in the existing media space, is the value attributed to creative assets. As media moved from print to digital, creative assets have lost the ability to control and maintain value throughout the web ecosystem. With NFTs, digital media now becomes a liquid financial asset secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts. \\n\\nCurrently, each creator receives royalties in perpetuity when their NFTs are sold on the secondary market. [As Flynn explains in his latest piece](https://jammsession.mirror.xyz/-xYcfFRlhDdLDSUgRMTYJAaRJBs2VG4LP34DnOV84mI), NFT creators in the future will have two paths: independent or collective. As an independent, creators can realize the full upside of their NFT creations and earn built-in royalties. But the collective model is an entirely new way to build distribution. Because the NFTs are programmable, the royalties can be broken down further into fractional shares. Instead of a creator earning their full share of royalties on share, they can distribute royalties to agents or collectives, who can help the creator gain distribution opportunities for the NFT.\\n\\nLet’s get pragmatic again-- Similar to that IMDB is a database of media attached to a single creator or operator, the ledger will now provide a graph representing the creator or operator to every piece of media they are associated with or a contributor to. When the NFT is sold, all creators who were part of the DAO are time stamped with a block number, representing a creator’s affiliation with the process or moment in time they were a part of.\\n\\nBut there’s more. Another benefit of NFTs is that they turn digital media into public goods with pseudonymous ownership. A digital media file that’s minted as an NFT can be read by everyone, but owned as a collectible by a single entity. This provides a new monetization channel for digital media without limiting growth by putting content behind a paywall. It also revitalizes business models that used to be lucrative in the print era but lost in the digital era like the wire service. \\n\\nThere are parallel efforts throughout the media and tech ecosystem to try and get to the same place; how do we evolve the media’s infrastructure to draw benefit for the talent, the support and the community? In order to capitalize on providing an infrastructure that benefits all parties, the foundation needs to be broken down and built back up again. It’s very hard to renovate a business, especially one that hasn’t been built on the criteria for the new era. The creator economy started tearing down the foundation of legacy media’s structure to encourage both existing media companies and new entrants to think about building for and enabling talent based companies. As both businesses begin to map out the next iteration of their technical and business architecture, there is infrastructure being mapped out that is ripe for all economies to be built on top of-- the ownership economy. \\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n***Support your local artists***\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/1688)\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI\",\"timestamp\":1614618595,\"title\":\"A New Media Structure: The Ownership Economy\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"entry:9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\":{\"__typename\":\"entry\",\"_id\":\"9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\",\"body\":\"![Trey Anastasio, Phish, Nashville 2018](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/25cafc24-71f1-4f50-93e6-02ada2762b21.jpeg?height=1620\\u0026width=2160)\\n\\nIf media companies are record labels and creators are rock stars then the audience are fans — and that introduces an entirely new business opportunity.\\nMedia, like music, can only thrive when the audience and the creator travel down a path together, giving each other the opportunity to define one another. It’s a two-way street, not a top-down dictum. But what happens when a creator or artist gets so big that their audience starts building products on top of their work?\\n\\nThe media’s status quo is accelerating towards disruption. We’re seeing the development of new media brands (micro-labels) on platforms and services, the prioritization of talent as a core business pillar by media companies and the shifting business models moving from content direct to creator direct.\\n\\nAs each component of creation evolves, there is another evolution happening with the most critical part of the media business’ formula: the consumers. In the media business, business models drive product strategy. And while that’s the driving force behind the product, it’s contingent on consumer interest, participation and loyalty. That means that as the economy shifts, so needs the consumer value. This is an opportunity to build a new business that puts the creator and consumer relationship front and center and introduces the element of ownership. This is the business of fandom and subcultures.\\n\\nCreators should be in the business of eliciting and manufacturing subculture.\\n\\nSubcultures develop as a response to a pre-existing culture. In the case of music and media, that pre-existing culture or categorization is the genre. The desire to fit within a pre-existing genre, traditionally, has been beneficial for the artist. Genres set the taste broadly for what the listener or reader should expect from the artist or creator within that category. There is an existing audience, an existing business model — the foundation is set.\\n\\nThe goal is to bust through genres and create a subgenre (subcultures) of its own. Think of it on both sides: the creator (or label) develops their own identity in response to genre a la Sub-Pop and the fans develop their own identity and subculture in response to it a la Punk. In the era of niche, the approach is quite the opposite. Instead of creating for the broader audience, the fashion is now to style the particular few. It’s less about scale and more about the quality of the audience who wants it. By doing this, not only do creators open up a unique pocket of value for themselves but their community starts to construct an identity out of the value that’s been created.\\n\\nThe relationship between creator and consumers is more valuable than its transactional currency (ie. content). In this era of media, the content is not the only product. The content is a key part of the value in that it’s the tool for consistency but the creator and the community are the product. The true value is the connection between consumer and creator acquired through a variety of access points that eventually develop a consumer benefit. As the business moves from content is value to creator is value we should shift the business opportunities that support it as well.\\nThe consumer builds on the brand.\\n\\nCreators should be in the business of eliciting and manufacturing subculture. For a creator, culture is when their brand is so transportable, that commerce and community are built outside of the creator itself. If membership enables identity, and identity builds brand then culture is eternal. When the consumers become the creators and associate their value with not just building within the creator environment but outside of it as well, the creator becomes a platform. Businesses are being built on top of the creator, separate from their participation because of the consumers commitment and dedication to their brand. The creator is the platform. In this example, the relationship is not just with the content, the creator and the community, but in the development of a subculture itself. The audience isn’t a commodity. Instead, the audience views themself as a part of the brand, and associate their own ideas with their consumption and engagement with the creator. An example of this is the band Phish.\\n\\nThrough the music, brand and community of Phish, an entire subculture has developed around the group to the point where there are businesses, identities and communities built outside of the band’s direct participation. Phish is the creator but the nature of their creation (ie. music and community) and their development of culture has turned their fans into creators themselves. They can leverage the Phish audience to develop their own audiences, thus expanding the brand and culture. Like The Grateful Dead’s shakedown scene, Phish has built themselves as a platform for consumers (in this case fans) to build their business on top of. As a result, the brand becomes immortal through their association in the foundation of the community’s business. In the Phish subculture, there are many fan built establishments across a variety of trades.\\n\\nThere is Phish.net run by Scott Marks and team that compile set-lists, news and analysis on the band and their associated projects in real-time. Phantasy Tour, a reddit-esque forum developed by fans for fans has become the defacto platform for all fans to discuss… anything. Here, a fan (and one of my dear friends), is seeking mid-century modern furniture for his new house. The first post maxed out at 499 responses (499’d!) and it spilled over to a second thread. He chose to have this conversation on Phantasy Tour and found the perfect chair.\\n\\nThere is a completely robust ecosystem of commerce developed, designed and distributed by fans. The band influenced, independent and run JEMP Radio and Phish Just Jams are music applications built on top of the catalog to service a particular interest, a particular niche. Fan photographers have built an entire business and reputation around their art, one of my favorites being AZN. There’s even a physical marketplace for commerce at live events in the cities the band plays in. Beyond commerce, there are a lot of societal benefits to the growing subculture. For example, the Phellowship is a fan lead group of fans who choose to be drug and alcohol free.\\n\\nIn the culture Phish defined, the subculture now dictates the identity and longevity of the brand in its ability to live in perpetuity. The fans themselves are defining the culture as well as the brand through business. Granted, this took over 30 years and compounds all the time.\\n\\nFunny enough, this entire movement towards the creator economy with the unbundling and rebundling of media operations and platforms is itself a media subculture. Creators and supporting platforms and services are looking to challenge the interpretive authority of media institutions and their structure by building providence of their own. For some creator’s it’s less about the business and more about the desire to break through the establishment and promote individual freedom and construct an environment of their own. Many that go independent could potentially earn less than if they stayed at an establishment, but that’s not the point. And this is a signal both for how incumbents need to prepare against challengers and how businesses need to be set up to provide a platform for subculture momentum.\\n\\nA business of subculture and fandom has always existed in music. Phish has taken it to the next level by not only making their consumers creators, but also making them owners. They are very much in the lead here and, against the strong insistence of opportunity in this piece, will be difficult replicate.\\nThe media business has traditionally been built around content. There have been hints of culture driven commerce throughout the years in the NYT blue bag, the New Yorker tote bag, but most of these attempts teetered on the edge of membership and nowhere near the manufacturing of subcultures. We are seeing new media companies begin to work towards this opportunity of moving consumer identity down the line from someone who subscribes, to someone who’s a member, to someone who sees the brand as part of their culture. As business models drive product strategy, the business of manufacturing subculture can’t just be a phenomenon, it must also be a source of brand growth. Encouraging fandom and moving to an environment where consumers become the creators is insurance and future proofing your brand.\\n\\nSubcultures happen organically with time but they can be pushed towards a direction and accelerated. This tied simply to the idea of brand — in order to drive culture, your brand must have a point of view. In order to drive subculture, you must elicit a response from your consumer who themselves have a point of view. A way to trigger this is to unlock your brand. Rights management is important, and culture is driven through commerce, but holding it too tight means you forfeit earned media potential and the ability for your consumer to become a creator. Consumers becoming creators are good for your brand, especially if it’s built with your brand in mind. The end goal is to have the brand be so associated with the consumer identity, that some even model their life, or business, around it.\\n\\nAnother great example is the agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, Big Hit. They recently listed their initial public offering and it had been massively oversubscribed by both institutional and retail investors. Fans are literally investing in the artists success and are incentivized for them to do well. The fourth wall is breaking.\\n\\nBTS Won't Stay Forever Young. The K-Pop Sensation's Owner Needs New Big Hits.\\nKorean pop music, or K-pop, has taken the world by storm. It is shaking up the financial markets, too. \\n\\nThere are many emerging creators that are building culture through community that, through time and commitment, will elicit subculture. As defined and showcased above, the business of subculture is different from the development of subculture. This is about reversing the flow of expectations about the fans role from a passive consumer to an actual business creator. There is a lot of momentum in the gaming space, especially with the commerce, branding and communities being built by the likes of MrBeast and Ninja, and my expectation is that this is the obvious next phase in their brand expansion.\\n\\nThe environment has changed and so have the platforms. This opportunity is truly rooted in the digital landscape. As media companies work to become record labels and independent creators start their own brands, or collaborate with others to create their own micro label, the business models should follow. As we unbundle and rebundle the operational structure of what a media company is, we should equally unbundle and rebundle the way we drive that business and where we put the emphasis of value. As explained above, that’s a move from content as value to creator as value. And as we shift further away from content and towards the creator, the existing structure of subscription and membership will limit the opportunity for a brand to expand in this next age.\\n\\nSo we enter the business of subculture with a focus on building a brand as a platform. Those that invest in brokering deeper connections with their fans, and enabling them to become creators on behalf of a brand will be way ahead of the curve. There is an incredible opportunity ahead of us in the media industry and I’m excited to see what you all build.\",\"hideTitleInEntry\":null,\"publishStatus\":\"public\",\"publishedAtTimestamp\":null,\"originalDigest\":\"9RU2OOwUxzZCPsJP6OISJiQV7F8io7G9TtxmAASt3Dg\",\"timestamp\":1610660306,\"title\":\"Breaking the Fourth Wall: The Business of Media Subculture\",\"arweaveTransactionRequest\":null,\"featuredImageId\":null,\"featuredImage\":null,\"publisher\":{\"__typename\":\"PublisherType\",\"project\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"},\"member\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}},\"latestBlockData\":{\"__typename\":\"LatestBlockDataType\",\"timestamp\":1646851357,\"number\":14354267},\"collaborators\":[],\"editions\":[]},\"ROOT_QUERY\":{\"__typename\":\"Query\",\"projectFeed({\\\"projectAddress\\\":\\\"darkstar.mirror.xyz\\\"})\":{\"__ref\":\"ProjectType:0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\"}}}},\"__N_SSG\":true},\"page\":\"/_sites/[slug]\",\"query\":{\"slug\":\"darkstar\"},\"buildId\":\"0s-4eGf5UyNXzmZoSHvIK\",\"isFallback\":false,\"gsp\":true,\"scriptLoader\":[]}</script></body></html>","oembed":false,"readabilityObject":{"title":"Dark Star","content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p><strong>We are entering the age of living online</strong>.
