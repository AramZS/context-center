It was bad enough having to beg my\nfriends and family to avoid &ldquo;investing&rdquo; in the scam without having the scam\nbreak into my business and trash the place every day.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, we threatened to <a href=\"https://sourcehut.org/blog/2023-01-09-gomodulemirror/\">blacklist the Go module mirror</a> because for\nsome reason the Go team thinks that running terabytes of git clones all day,\nevery day for every Go project on git.sr.ht is cheaper than maintaining any\nstate or using webhooks or coordinating the work between instances or even just\ndesigning a module system that doesn&rsquo;t require Google to DoS git forges whose\nentire annual budgets are considerably smaller than a single Google engineer&rsquo;s\nsalary.</p>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s LLMs. If you think these crawlers respect robots.txt then you are\nseveral assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl\neverything they can find, robots.txt be damned, including expensive endpoints\nlike git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in every repo, and\nthey do so using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come from\ntens of thousands of IP addresses &ndash; mostly residential, in unrelated subnets,\neach one making no more than one HTTP request over any time period we tried to\nmeasure &ndash; actively and maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user\ntraffic and avoiding attempts to characterize their behavior or block their\ntraffic.</p>\n<p>We are experiencing dozens of brief outages per week, and I have to review our\nmitigations several times per day to keep that number from getting any higher.\nWhen I do have time to work on something else, often I have to drop it when all\nof our alarms go off because our current set of mitigations stopped working.\nSeveral high-priority tasks at SourceHut have been delayed weeks or even months\nbecause we keep being interrupted to deal with these bots, and many users have\nbeen negatively affected because our mitigations can&rsquo;t always reliably\ndistinguish users from bots.</p>\n<p>All of my sysadmin friends are dealing with the same problems.

This isn’t the first time SourceHut has\nbeen at the wrong end of some malicious bullshit or paid someone else’s\nexternalized costs – every couple of years someone invents a new way of ruining\nmy day.\nFour years ago, we decided to require payment to use our CI services\nbecause it was being abused to mine cryptocurrency. We alternated between\nperiods of designing and deploying tools to curb this abuse and periods of\nnear-complete outage when they adapted to our mitigations and saturated all of\nour compute with miners seeking a profit. It was bad enough having to beg my\nfriends and family to avoid “investing” in the scam without having the scam\nbreak into my business and trash the place every day.\nTwo years ago, we threatened to blacklist the Go module mirror because for\nsome reason the Go team thinks that running terabytes of git clones all day,\nevery day for every Go project on git.sr.ht is cheaper than maintaining any\nstate or using webhooks or coordinating the work between instances or even just\ndesigning a module system that doesn’t require Google to DoS git forges whose\nentire annual budgets are considerably smaller than a single Google engineer’s\nsalary.\nNow it’s LLMs. If you think these crawlers respect robots.txt then you are\nseveral assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl\neverything they can find, robots.txt be damned, including expensive endpoints\nlike git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in every repo, and\nthey do so using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come from\ntens of thousands of IP addresses – mostly residential, in unrelated subnets,\neach one making no more than one HTTP request over any time period we tried to\nmeasure – actively and maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user\ntraffic and avoiding attempts to characterize their behavior or block their\ntraffic.\nWe are experiencing dozens of brief outages per week, and I have to review our\nmitigations several times per day to keep that number from getting any higher.\nWhen I do have time to work on something else, often I have to drop it when all\nof our alarms go off because our current set of mitigations stopped working.\nSeveral high-priority tasks at SourceHut have been delayed weeks or even months\nbecause we keep being interrupted to deal with these bots, and many users have\nbeen negatively affected because our mitigations can’t always reliably\ndistinguish users from bots.\nAll of my sysadmin friends are dealing with the same problems. I was asking one\nof them for feedback on a draft of this article and our discussion was\ninterrupted to go deal with a new wave of LLM bots on their own server. Every\ntime I sit down for beers or dinner or to socialize with my sysadmin friends\nit’s not long before we’re complaining about the bots and asking if the other\nhas cracked the code to getting rid of them once and for all. The desperation in\nthese conversations is palpable.\nWhether it’s cryptocurrency scammers mining with FOSS compute resources or\nGoogle engineers too lazy to design their software properly or Silicon Valley\nripping off all the data they can get their hands on at everyone else’s expense…\nI am sick and tired of having all of these costs externalized directly into my\nfucking face. Do something productive for society or get the hell away from my\nservers. Put all of those billions and billions of dollars towards the common\ngood before sysadmins collectively start a revolution to do it for you.\nPlease stop legitimizing LLMs or AI image generators or GitHub Copilot or any of\nthis garbage. I am begging you to stop using them, stop talking about them, stop\nmaking new ones, just stop. If blasting CO2 into the air and\nruining all of our freshwater and traumatizing cheap laborers and making every\nsysadmin you know miserable and ripping off code and books and art at scale and\nruining our fucking democracy isn’t enough for you to leave this shit alone,\nwhat is?\nIf you personally work on developing LLMs et al, know this: I will never work\nwith you again, and I will remember which side you picked when the bubble\nbursts.\n\n  \n\n  \n    Articles from blogs I read\n    \n      Generated by\n      openring\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        When Flat Rate Movers Won't Answer Your Calls\n      \n      Back in 2023 I went through an inter-state move with Flat Rate Movers,\nLTD.
