Datetime\n   negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the\n   given resource&#x27;s URI and a user agent&#x27;s preferred datetime.  TimeMaps\n   are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior\n   states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates\n   recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of\n   another resource.\n\nStatus of This Memo\n\n   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational purposes.\n\n   This is a contribution to the RFC Series, independently of any other\n   RFC stream.

A Memento\n      for an Original Resource as it existed at time T is a resource\n      that encapsulates the state the Original Resource had at time T.\n\n   o  TimeGate: A TimeGate for an Original Resource is a resource that\n      is capable of datetime negotiation to support access to prior\n      states of the Original Resource.\n\n   o  TimeMap: A TimeMap for an Original Resource is a resource from\n      which a list of URIs of Mementos of the Original Resource is\n      available.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-1.2\" href=\"#section-1.2\">1.2</a>.

Purpose</span>\n\n   The state of an Original Resource may change over time.\n   Dereferencing its URI at any specific moment yields a response that\n   reflects the resource&#x27;s state at that moment: a representation of the\n   resource&#x27;s state (e.g., &quot;200 OK&quot; HTTP status code), an indication of\n   its nonexistence (e.g., &quot;404 Not Found&quot; HTTP status code), a relation\n   to another resource (e.g., &quot;302 Found&quot; HTTP status code), etc.\n   However, responses may also exist that reflect prior states of an\n   Original Resource: a representation of a prior state of the Original\n   Resource, an indication that the Original Resource did not exist at\n   some time in the past, a relation that the Original Resource had to\n   another resource at some time in the past, etc.  Mementos that\n   provide such responses exist in Web archives, content management\n   systems, or revision control systems, among others.  For any given\n   Original Resource several Mementos may exist, each one reflecting a\n   frozen prior state of the Original Resource.\n\n   Examples are:\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\">http://www.ietf.org/</a> are as follows:\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/\">http://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/</a>\n\n   o  <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://www.ietf.org/\">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://</a>\n      <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://www.ietf.org/\">www.ietf.org/</a>\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</a> are as\n   follows:\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/</a>\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">index</a>.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=366806574\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/</a>\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">index</a>.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=33912\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">http://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/</a>\n      <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</a>\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/</a> are as\n   follows:\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/</a>\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/</a>\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://archive.fo/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\">http://archive.is/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/</a>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

The abstract notion of the state of an Original Resource (URI-R)\n       as it existed at datetime T.  Note the relationship with the\n       ability to identify the state of a resource at datetime T by\n       means of a URI as intended by the proposed Dated URI scheme\n       [<a href=\"#ref-DATED-URI\" title=\"&quot;The &#x27;tdb&#x27; and &#x27;duri&#x27; URI schemes, based on dated URIs&quot;\">DATED-URI</a>].\n\n   2.  A &quot;bridge&quot; from the present to the past, consisting of:\n\n       o  The existence of a TimeGate (URI-G), which is aware of (at\n          least part of the) version history of the Original Resource\n          (URI-R);\n\n       o  The ability to negotiate in the datetime dimension with that\n          TimeGate (URI-G), as a means to access the state that the\n          Original Resource (URI-R) had at datetime T.\n\n   3.  A &quot;bridge&quot; from the past to the present, consisting of an\n       appropriately typed link from a Memento (URI-M), which\n       encapsulates the state the Original Resource (URI-R) had at\n       datetime T, to the Original Resource (URI-R).\n\n   4.  The existence of a TimeMap (URI-T) from which a list of all\n       Mementos that encapsulate a prior state of the Original Resource\n       (URI-R) can be obtained.\n\n   This document is concerned with specifying an instantiation of these\n   abstractions for resources that are identified by HTTP(S) URIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

HTTP Headers, Link Relation Types</span>\n\n   The Memento framework is concerned with HEAD and GET interactions\n   with Original Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps that are\n   identified by HTTP or HTTPS URIs.  Details are only provided for\n   resources identified by HTTP URIs but apply similarly to those with\n   HTTPS URIs.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-2.1\" href=\"#section-2.1\">2.1</a>.  HTTP Headers</span>\n\n   The Memento framework operates at the level of HTTP request and\n   response headers.  It introduces two new headers (&quot;Accept-Datetime&quot;\n   and &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot;) and introduces new values for two existing\n   headers (&quot;Vary&quot; and &quot;Link&quot;).  Other HTTP headers are present or\n   absent in Memento response/request cycles as specified by [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc2616\" title=\"&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;\">RFC2616</a>].\n\n<span class=\"h4\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-2.1.1\" href=\"#section-2.1.1\">2.1.1</a>.  Accept-Datetime and Memento-Datetime</span>\n\n   The &quot;Accept-Datetime&quot; request header is transmitted by a user agent\n   to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource.\n   To that end, the &quot;Accept-Datetime&quot; header is conveyed in an HTTP\n   request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its\n   value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the\n   Original Resource.\n\n   Example of an &quot;Accept-Datetime&quot; request header:\n\n   Accept-Datetime: Thu, 31 May 2007 20:35:00 GMT\n\n   The &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; response header is used by a server to\n   indicate that a response reflects a prior state of an Original\n   Resource.  Its value expresses the datetime of that state.  The URI\n   of the Original Resource for which the response reflects a prior\n   state is provided as the Target IRI of a link provided in the HTTP\n   &quot;Link&quot; header that has a Relation Type of &quot;original&quot; (see\n   <a href=\"#section-2.2\">Section 2.2</a>).\n\n   The presence of a &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; header and associated value for\n   a given response constitutes a promise that the resource state\n   reflected in the response will no longer change (see <a href=\"#section-4.5.6\">Section 4.5.6</a>).\n\n   Example of a &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; response header:\n\n   Memento-Datetime: Wed, 30 May 2007 18:47:52 GMT\n\n   Values for the &quot;Accept-Datetime&quot; and &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; headers\n   consist of a MANDATORY datetime expressed according to the [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc1123\" title=\"&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support&quot;\">RFC1123</a>]\n   format, which is formalized by the <a href=\"/doc/html/rfc1123\">rfc1123</a>-date construction rule of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

Overview of the Memento Framework</span>\n\n   The Memento framework defines two complementary approaches to support\n   obtaining representations of prior states of an Original Resource:\n\n   o  Datetime Negotiation: Datetime negotiation is a variation on\n      content negotiation by which a user agent expresses a datetime\n      preference pertaining to the representation of an Original\n      Resource, instead of, for example, a media type preference.  Based\n      on the responding server&#x27;s knowledge of the past of the Original\n      Resource, it selects a Memento of the Original Resource that best\n      meets the user agent&#x27;s datetime preference.  An overview is\n      provided in <a href=\"#section-3.1\">Section 3.1</a>; details are in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>.\n\n   o  TimeMaps: A TimeMap is a resource from which a list can be\n      obtained that provides a comprehensive overview of the past of an\n      Original Resource.  A server makes a TimeMap available that\n      enumerates all Mementos that the server is aware of, along with\n      their archival datetime.  A user agent can obtain the TimeMap and\n      select Mementos from it.  An overview is provided in <a href=\"#section-3.2\">Section 3.2</a>;\n      details are in <a href=\"#section-5\">Section 5</a>.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-3.1\" href=\"#section-3.1\">3.1</a>.  Datetime Negotiation</span>\n\n   Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of a successful request/\n   response chain that involves datetime negotiation.  Dashed lines\n   depict HTTP transactions between user agent and server.  The\n   interactions are for a scenario where the Original Resource resides\n   on one server, whereas both its TimeGate and Mementos reside on\n   another (Pattern 2.1 (<a href=\"#section-4.2.1\">Section 4.2.1</a>) in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>).  Scenarios also\n   exist in which all these resources are on the same server (for\n   example, content management systems) or all are on different servers\n   (for example, an aggregator of TimeGates).\n\n   1: UA --- HTTP HEAD/GET; Accept-Datetime: T ----------------&gt; URI-R\n   2: UA &lt;-- HTTP 200; Link: URI-G ----------------------------- URI-R\n   3: UA --- HTTP HEAD/GET; Accept-Datetime: T ----------------&gt; URI-G\n   4: UA &lt;-- HTTP 302; Location: URI-M; Vary; Link:\n         URI-R,URI-T ------------------------------------------&gt; URI-G\n   5: UA --- HTTP GET URI-M; Accept-Datetime: T ---------------&gt; URI-M\n   6: UA &lt;-- HTTP 200; Memento-Datetime: T; Link:\n         URI-R,URI-T,URI-G ------------------------------------- URI-M\n\n          Figure 2: A Datetime Negotiation Request/Response Chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

In\n            addition, the response contains an HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header with a\n            Relation Type of &quot;original&quot; pointing at the Original\n            Resource (URI-R), and an HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header with a Relation\n            Type of &quot;timemap&quot; pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T).\n\n   Step 5:  The user agent issues an HTTP GET request against URI-M.\n\n   Step 6:  The response from URI-M includes a &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; HTTP\n            header with a value of the archival datetime of the Memento.\n            It also contains an HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header with a Relation Type\n            of &quot;original&quot; pointing at the Original Resource (URI-R),\n            with a Relation Type of &quot;timegate&quot; pointing at a TimeGate\n            (URI-G) for the Original Resource, and with a Relation Type\n            of &quot;timemap&quot; pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T) for the Original\n            Resource.  The state that is expressed by the response is\n            the state the Original Resource had at the archival datetime\n            expressed in the &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; header.\n\n   In order to respond to a datetime negotiation request, the server\n   uses an internal algorithm to select the Memento that best meets the\n   user agent&#x27;s datetime preference.  The exact nature of the selection\n   algorithm is at the server&#x27;s discretion but is intended to be\n   consistent, for example, always selecting the Memento that is nearest\n   in time relative to the requested datetime, always selecting the\n   Memento that is nearest in the past relative to the requested\n   datetime, etc.\n\n   Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most systems, the value of the\n   &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; header returned by a server may differ\n   (significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in &quot;Accept-\n   Datetime&quot;.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

Various reasons exist why there are significant chances\n   these would be different yet do convey substantially the same\n   information.  These include format migrations as part of a digital\n   preservation strategy, URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives,\n   and the addition of banners as a means to brand Web archives.\n\n   When negotiating in the datetime dimension, the regular content\n   negotiation dimensions (media type, character encoding, language, and\n   compression) remain available.  It is the TimeGate server&#x27;s\n   responsibility to honor (or not) such content negotiation, and in\n   doing so it MUST always first select a Memento that meets the user\n   agent&#x27;s datetime preference, and then consider honoring regular\n   content negotiation for it.  As a result of this approach, the\n   returned Memento will not necessarily meet the user agent&#x27;s regular\n   content negotiation preferences.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that\n   the server provides &quot;memento&quot; links in the HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header\n   pointing at Mementos that do meet the user agent&#x27;s regular content\n   negotiation requests and that have a value for the &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot;\n   header in the temporal vicinity of the user agent&#x27;s preferred\n   datetime value.\n\n   A user agent that engages in datetime negotiation with a resource\n   typically starts by issuing an HTTP HEAD, not GET, request with an\n   &quot;Accept-Datetime&quot; header in order to determine how to proceed.  This\n   strategy is related to the existence of various server implementation\n   patterns as will become clear in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>.\n\n   Details about the HTTP interactions involved in datetime negotiation\n   are provided in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-3.2\" href=\"#section-3.2\">3.2</a>.

But servers that\n   maintain their own history, such as content management systems and\n   version control systems, may also implement this pattern, for\n   example, to distribute the load involved in responding to requests\n   for current and prior representations of resources between different\n   servers.\n\n   This pattern is summarized in the below table and is detailed in the\n   remainder of this section.  Three cases exist that differ regarding\n   the negotiation style that is used by the remote TimeGate and\n   regarding the existence of a URI-M for Mementos that is distinct from\n   the URI-G of the TimeGate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

Pattern 4 - Mementos without a TimeGate</span>\n\n   Cases may occur in which a server hosts Mementos but does not expose\n   a TimeGate for them.  This can, for example, be the case if the\n   server&#x27;s Mementos result from taking a snapshot of the state of a set\n   of Original Resources from another server as it is being retired.  As\n   a result, only a single Memento per Original Resource is hosted,\n   making the introduction of a TimeGate unnecessary.  But it may also\n   be the case for servers that host multiple Mementos for an Original\n   Resource but consider exposing TimeGates too expensive.  In this\n   case, URI-R and URI-M are distinct, but a TimeGate is absent.  This\n   case is summarized in the below table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

The\n   user agent MUST behave in the same manner as it does with HTTP\n   responses with a 3XX status code that do not have a &quot;Memento-\n   Datetime&quot; header.\n\n   However, the user agent MUST be aware that the URI that was selected\n   from the &quot;Location&quot; header of an HTTP response with a 3XX status code\n   might not be that of a Memento but rather of an Original Resource.\n   In the latter case, it SHOULD proceed by looking for a Memento of the\n   selected Original Resource.\n\n   For example, Figure 20 shows the response to an HTTP GET request for\n   http://a.example.org issued on April 11, 2008.  This response is\n   archived as a Memento of http://a.example.org that has as URI-M\n   http://arxiv.example.net/web/20080411000650/http://a.example.org.\n   The response to an HTTP GET on this URI-M is shown in Figure 21.  It\n   is a replay of the original response with &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; and\n   &quot;Link&quot; headers added, to allow a user agent to understand the\n   response is a Memento.  In Figure 21, the value of the &quot;Location&quot;\n   header is the same as in the original response; it identifies an\n   Original Resource.  The user agent proceeds with finding a Memento\n   for this Original Resource.  Web archives sometimes overwrite the\n   value that was originally provided in the &quot;Location&quot; header in order\n   to point at a Memento they hold of the resource to which the redirect\n   originally led.  This is shown in Figure 22.  In this case, the user\n   agent may decide it found an appropriate Memento.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n   Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2008 00:06:50 GMT\n   Server: Apache\n   Location: http://b.example.org\n   Content-Length: 0\n   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n                     Figure 20: Response Is a Redirect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

For example, when\n      mirroring, the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header will be updated to reflect\n      the time of mirroring at the new URI, whereas the value for\n      &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; will be maintained.\n\n<span class=\"h4\"><a class=\"selflink\" id=\"section-4.5.7\" href=\"#section-4.5.7\">4.5.7</a>.  Intermediate Resources</span>\n\n   An intermediate resource is a resource that issues a redirect to a\n   TimeGate, to a Memento, or to another intermediate resource, and thus\n   plays an active role in the Memento infrastructure.  Intermediate\n   resources commonly exist in Web archives on the path from a TimeGate\n   to an appropriate Memento.\n\n   A response of an intermediate resource has an HTTP status code\n   indicative of HTTP redirection (e.g., 302) and uses Memento headers\n   and links that allow user agents to recognize that the resource plays\n   a role in the Memento framework:\n\n   o  A &quot;Vary&quot; header that includes an &quot;accept-datetime&quot; value MUST NOT\n      be provided.\n\n   o  The response MUST NOT include a &quot;Memento-Datetime&quot; header.\n\n   o  The &quot;Link&quot; header MUST be provided, and it MUST have a link with\n      the &quot;original&quot; Relation Type that has the URI-R of the associated\n      Original Resource as Target IRI.  Links with &quot;timegate&quot;,\n      &quot;timemap&quot;, and &quot;memento&quot; Relation Types are OPTIONAL and, if\n      provided, MUST pertain to the Original Resource for which the user\n      agent is trying to obtain a Memento.\n\n   A user agent MUST follow a redirection provided by an intermediate\n   resource; multiple such redirections can be chained.\n\n   Consider the case where a user agent follows the &quot;timegate&quot; link\n   provided in Figure 10 and engages in datetime negotiation with the\n   assumed TimeGate in the manner shown in Figure 11.  But instead of\n   receiving a response as shown in Figure 12, it receives the one shown\n   below in Figure 25.  Such a response is unambiguously recognizable as\n   coming from an intermediate resource.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

Resources Excluded from Datetime Negotiation</span>\n\n   When delivering a Memento to a user agent, a Web archive commonly\n   enhances that Memento&#x27;s archived content, for example, by including a\n   banner that provides branding and highlights the archival status of\n   the Memento.  The resources that are involved in providing such\n   system-specific functionality, many times JavaScript or images, must\n   be used in their current state.\n\n   A server that generally supports datetime negotiation should make\n   resources that need to be excluded from datetime negotiation\n   recognizable.  Doing so allows a user agent to refrain from\n   attempting to access a Memento for them.  In order to achieve this,\n   the server SHOULD include a special-purpose link in the HTTP &quot;Link&quot;\n   header when responding to an HTTP HEAD/GET request to a resource\n   excluded from datetime negotiation.  This link has\n   &quot;http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate&quot; as Target IRI and\n   &quot;type&quot;, defined in [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc6903\" title=\"&quot;Additional Link Relation Types&quot;\">RFC6903</a>], as the value of the &quot;rel&quot; attribute.\n   Other Memento headers as defined in <a href=\"#section-2.1\">Section 2.1</a> SHOULD NOT be\n   provided.\n\n   Figure 26 shows the response to an HTTP HEAD request from a resource\n   excluded from datetime negotiation.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n   Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2010 00:09:40 GMT\n   Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\n   Link: &lt;<a href=\"http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate\">http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate</a>&gt;; rel=&quot;type&quot;\n   Content-Length: 238\n   Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n   Figure 26: Response to an HTTP HEAD Request from a Resource Excluded\n                         from Datetime Negotiation\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

TimeMaps: Content and Serialization</span>\n\n   A TimeMap is introduced to support retrieving a comprehensive list of\n   all Mementos for a specific Original Resource known to a server.  The\n   entity-body of a response to an HTTP GET request issued against a\n   TimeMap&#x27;s URI-T:\n\n   o  MUST list the URI-R of the Original Resource that the TimeMap is\n      about;\n\n   o  MUST list the URI-M and archival datetime of each Memento for the\n      Original Resource known to the server, preferably in a single\n      document, or, alternatively in multiple documents that can be\n      gathered by following contained links with a &quot;timemap&quot; Relation\n      Type;\n\n   o  SHOULD list the URI-G of one or more TimeGates for the Original\n      Resource known to the responding server;\n\n   o  SHOULD, for self-containment, list the URI-T of the TimeMap\n      itself;\n\n   o  MUST unambiguously type listed resources as being Original\n      Resource, TimeGate, Memento, or TimeMap.\n\n   The entity-body of a response from a TimeMap MAY be serialized in\n   various ways, but the link-value format serialization described here\n   MUST be supported.  In this serialization, the entity-body MUST be\n   formatted in the same way as the value of an HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header, and\n   hence MUST comply to the &quot;link-value&quot; construction rule of <a href=\"#section-5\">Section 5</a>.\n   The Link header field of [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc5988\" title=\"&quot;Web Linking&quot;\">RFC5988</a>], and the media type of the entity-\n   body MUST be &quot;application/link-format&quot; as introduced in [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc6690\" title=\"&quot;Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format&quot;\">RFC6690</a>].\n   Links contained in the entity-body MUST be interpreted as follows:\n\n   o  The Context IRI is set to the anchor parameter, when specified;\n\n   o  The Context IRI of links with the &quot;self&quot; Relation Types is the\n      URI-T of the TimeMap, i.e., the URI of the resource from which the\n      TimeMap was requested;\n\n   o  The Context IRI of all other links is the URI-R of the Original\n      Resource, which is provided as the Target IRI of the link with an\n      &quot;original&quot; Relation Type.\n\n   In order to retrieve the link-value serialization of a TimeMap, a\n   user agent uses an &quot;Accept&quot; request header with a value set to\n   &quot;application/link-format&quot;.

Mementos for TimeMaps</span>\n\n   A TimeMap itself can act as an Original Resource for which a TimeGate\n   and Mementos may exist.  Hence, the response from a TimeMap could\n   include a &quot;timegate&quot; link to a TimeGate via which prior TimeMap\n   versions are available.  And, in cases where URI-T=URI-R=URI-G (a\n   TimeMap is an Original Resource that acts as its own TimeGate), an\n   &quot;original&quot; link pointing at the TimeMap URI-T would be included.\n\n   Therefore, caution is required in cases where a TimeMap for an\n   Original Resource wants to explicitly express in a &quot;Link&quot; header for\n   which Original Resource it is a TimeMap.  It can do so by including a\n   &quot;timemap&quot; link that has the URI-R of the Original Resource as Context\n   IRI and the URI-T of the TimeMap as Target IRI.\n\n   Figure 31 shows the response to an HTTP HEAD request against a\n   TimeMap that has\n   http://arxiv.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org as URI-T.  This\n   TimeMap provides information about Mementos for the Original Resource\n   that has http://a.example.org as URI-R.  The response includes an\n   &quot;original&quot; link pointing to the Original Resource that this TimeMap\n   is about.  Note the use of the &quot;anchor&quot; attribute in this link to\n   convey the URI-R of that Original Resource.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

Security Considerations</span>\n\n   Provision of a &quot;timegate&quot; HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header in responses to requests\n   for an Original Resource that is protected (e.g., 401 or 403 HTTP\n   response codes) is OPTIONAL.  The inclusion of this Link when\n   requesting authentication is at the server&#x27;s discretion; cases may\n   exist in which a server protects the current state of a resource, but\n   supports open access to prior states and thus chooses to supply this\n   HTTP &quot;Link&quot; header.  Conversely, the server may choose to not\n   advertise the TimeGate URIs (e.g., they exist in an intranet archive)\n   for unauthenticated requests.\n\n   The veracity of archives and the relationships between Original\n   Resources and Mementos is beyond the scope of this document.  Even in\n   the absence of malice, it is possible for separate archives to have\n   different Mementos for the same Original Resource at the same\n   datetime if the state of the Original Resource was dependent on the\n   requesting archive&#x27;s user agent IP address, specific HTTP request\n   headers, and possibly other factors.\n\n   Further authentication, encryption, and other security-related issues\n   are otherwise orthogonal to Memento.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Van de Sompel, et al.

Datetime\n   negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the\n   given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps\n   are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior\n   states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates\n   recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of\n   another resource.\n\nStatus of This Memo\n\n   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational purposes.\n\n   This is a contribution to the RFC Series, independently of any other\n   RFC stream.

Terminology</span>\n\n   This specification uses the terms \"resource\", \"request\", \"response\",\n   \"entity-body\", \"content negotiation\", \"user agent\", and \"server\" as\n   described in [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc2616\" title=\"&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;\">RFC2616</a>], and it uses the terms \"representation\" and\n   \"resource state\" as described in [<a href=\"#ref-W3C.REC-aww-20041215\">W3C.REC-aww-20041215</a>].\n\n   In addition, the following terms specific to the Memento framework\n   are introduced:\n\n   o  Original Resource: An Original Resource is a resource that exists\n      or used to exist, and for which access to one of its prior states\n      may be required.\n\n   o  Memento: A Memento for an Original Resource is a resource that\n      encapsulates a prior state of the Original Resource.  A Memento\n      for an Original Resource as it existed at time T is a resource\n      that encapsulates the state the Original Resource had at time T.\n\n   o  TimeGate: A TimeGate for an Original Resource is a resource that\n      is capable of datetime negotiation to support access to prior\n      states of the Original Resource.\n\n   o  TimeMap: A TimeMap for an Original Resource is a resource from\n      which a list of URIs of Mementos of the Original Resource is\n      available.\n\n<span><a id=\"section-1.2\" href=\"#section-1.2\">1.2</a>.

Purpose</span>\n\n   The state of an Original Resource may change over time.\n   Dereferencing its URI at any specific moment yields a response that\n   reflects the resource's state at that moment: a representation of the\n   resource's state (e.g., \"200 OK\" HTTP status code), an indication of\n   its nonexistence (e.g., \"404 Not Found\" HTTP status code), a relation\n   to another resource (e.g., \"302 Found\" HTTP status code), etc.\n   However, responses may also exist that reflect prior states of an\n   Original Resource: a representation of a prior state of the Original\n   Resource, an indication that the Original Resource did not exist at\n   some time in the past, a relation that the Original Resource had to\n   another resource at some time in the past, etc.  Mementos that\n   provide such responses exist in Web archives, content management\n   systems, or revision control systems, among others.  For any given\n   Original Resource several Mementos may exist, each one reflecting a\n   frozen prior state of the Original Resource.\n\n   Examples are:\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\">http://www.ietf.org/</a> are as follows:\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/\">http://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/</a>\n\n   o  <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://www.ietf.org/\">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://</a>\n      <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://www.ietf.org/\">www.ietf.org/</a>\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</a> are as\n   follows:\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/</a>\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">index</a>.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=366806574\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/</a>\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index\">index</a>.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=33912\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">http://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/</a>\n      <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</a>\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/</a> are as\n   follows:\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/</a>\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/</a>\n\n   o  <a href=\"https://archive.fo/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\">http://archive.is/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/</a>\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

The abstract notion of the state of an Original Resource (URI-R)\n       as it existed at datetime T.  Note the relationship with the\n       ability to identify the state of a resource at datetime T by\n       means of a URI as intended by the proposed Dated URI scheme\n       [<a href=\"#ref-DATED-URI\" title=\"&quot;The 'tdb' and 'duri' URI schemes, based on dated URIs&quot;\">DATED-URI</a>].\n\n   2.  A \"bridge\" from the present to the past, consisting of:\n\n       o  The existence of a TimeGate (URI-G), which is aware of (at\n          least part of the) version history of the Original Resource\n          (URI-R);\n\n       o  The ability to negotiate in the datetime dimension with that\n          TimeGate (URI-G), as a means to access the state that the\n          Original Resource (URI-R) had at datetime T.\n\n   3.  A \"bridge\" from the past to the present, consisting of an\n       appropriately typed link from a Memento (URI-M), which\n       encapsulates the state the Original Resource (URI-R) had at\n       datetime T, to the Original Resource (URI-R).\n\n   4.  The existence of a TimeMap (URI-T) from which a list of all\n       Mementos that encapsulate a prior state of the Original Resource\n       (URI-R) can be obtained.\n\n   This document is concerned with specifying an instantiation of these\n   abstractions for resources that are identified by HTTP(S) URIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

HTTP Headers, Link Relation Types</span>\n\n   The Memento framework is concerned with HEAD and GET interactions\n   with Original Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps that are\n   identified by HTTP or HTTPS URIs.  Details are only provided for\n   resources identified by HTTP URIs but apply similarly to those with\n   HTTPS URIs.\n\n<span><a id=\"section-2.1\" href=\"#section-2.1\">2.1</a>.  HTTP Headers</span>\n\n   The Memento framework operates at the level of HTTP request and\n   response headers.  It introduces two new headers (\"Accept-Datetime\"\n   and \"Memento-Datetime\") and introduces new values for two existing\n   headers (\"Vary\" and \"Link\").  Other HTTP headers are present or\n   absent in Memento response/request cycles as specified by [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc2616\" title=\"&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;\">RFC2616</a>].\n\n<span><a id=\"section-2.1.1\" href=\"#section-2.1.1\">2.1.1</a>.  Accept-Datetime and Memento-Datetime</span>\n\n   The \"Accept-Datetime\" request header is transmitted by a user agent\n   to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource.\n   To that end, the \"Accept-Datetime\" header is conveyed in an HTTP\n   request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its\n   value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the\n   Original Resource.\n\n   Example of an \"Accept-Datetime\" request header:\n\n   Accept-Datetime: Thu, 31 May 2007 20:35:00 GMT\n\n   The \"Memento-Datetime\" response header is used by a server to\n   indicate that a response reflects a prior state of an Original\n   Resource.  Its value expresses the datetime of that state.  The URI\n   of the Original Resource for which the response reflects a prior\n   state is provided as the Target IRI of a link provided in the HTTP\n   \"Link\" header that has a Relation Type of \"original\" (see\n   <a href=\"#section-2.2\">Section 2.2</a>).\n\n   The presence of a \"Memento-Datetime\" header and associated value for\n   a given response constitutes a promise that the resource state\n   reflected in the response will no longer change (see <a href=\"#section-4.5.6\">Section 4.5.6</a>).\n\n   Example of a \"Memento-Datetime\" response header:\n\n   Memento-Datetime: Wed, 30 May 2007 18:47:52 GMT\n\n   Values for the \"Accept-Datetime\" and \"Memento-Datetime\" headers\n   consist of a MANDATORY datetime expressed according to the [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc1123\" title=\"&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support&quot;\">RFC1123</a>]\n   format, which is formalized by the <a href=\"/doc/html/rfc1123\">rfc1123</a>-date construction rule of\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Vary</span>\n\n   Generally, the \"Vary\" header is used in HTTP responses to indicate\n   the dimensions in which content negotiation is possible.  In the\n   Memento framework, a TimeGate uses the \"Vary\" header with a value\n   that includes \"accept-datetime\" to convey that datetime negotiation\n   is possible.\n\n   For example, this use of the \"Vary\" header indicates that datetime is\n   the only dimension in which negotiation is possible:\n\n   Vary: accept-datetime\n\n   The use of the \"Vary\" header in this example shows that both datetime\n   negotiation and media type content negotiation are possible:\n\n   Vary: accept-datetime, accept\n\n<span><a id=\"section-2.1.3\" href=\"#section-2.1.3\">2.1.3</a>.  Link</span>\n\n   The Memento framework defines the \"original\", \"timegate\", \"timemap\",\n   and \"memento\" Relation Types to convey typed links among Original\n   Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps.  They are defined in\n   <a href=\"#section-2.2\">Section 2.2</a>, below.  In addition, existing Relation Types may be\n   used, for example, to support navigating among Mementos.  Examples\n   are \"first\", \"last\", \"prev\", \"next\", \"predecessor-version\", and\n   \"successor-version\" as detailed in [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc5988\" title=\"&quot;Web Linking&quot;\">RFC5988</a>] and [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc5829\" title=\"&quot;Link Relation Types for Simple Version Navigation between Web Resources&quot;\">RFC5829</a>].\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

The \"from\" and \"until\" attributes may be used to\n   express the start and end of the temporal interval covered by\n   Mementos listed in the TimeMap.

Overview of the Memento Framework</span>\n\n   The Memento framework defines two complementary approaches to support\n   obtaining representations of prior states of an Original Resource:\n\n   o  Datetime Negotiation: Datetime negotiation is a variation on\n      content negotiation by which a user agent expresses a datetime\n      preference pertaining to the representation of an Original\n      Resource, instead of, for example, a media type preference.  Based\n      on the responding server's knowledge of the past of the Original\n      Resource, it selects a Memento of the Original Resource that best\n      meets the user agent's datetime preference.  An overview is\n      provided in <a href=\"#section-3.1\">Section 3.1</a>; details are in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>.\n\n   o  TimeMaps: A TimeMap is a resource from which a list can be\n      obtained that provides a comprehensive overview of the past of an\n      Original Resource.  A server makes a TimeMap available that\n      enumerates all Mementos that the server is aware of, along with\n      their archival datetime.  A user agent can obtain the TimeMap and\n      select Mementos from it.  An overview is provided in <a href=\"#section-3.2\">Section 3.2</a>;\n      details are in <a href=\"#section-5\">Section 5</a>.\n\n<span><a id=\"section-3.1\" href=\"#section-3.1\">3.1</a>.  Datetime Negotiation</span>\n\n   Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of a successful request/\n   response chain that involves datetime negotiation.  Dashed lines\n   depict HTTP transactions between user agent and server.  The\n   interactions are for a scenario where the Original Resource resides\n   on one server, whereas both its TimeGate and Mementos reside on\n   another (Pattern 2.1 (<a href=\"#section-4.2.1\">Section 4.2.1</a>) in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>).  Scenarios also\n   exist in which all these resources are on the same server (for\n   example, content management systems) or all are on different servers\n   (for example, an aggregator of TimeGates).\n\n   1: UA --- HTTP HEAD/GET; Accept-Datetime: T ----------------&gt; URI-R\n   2: UA &lt;-- HTTP 200; Link: URI-G ----------------------------- URI-R\n   3: UA --- HTTP HEAD/GET; Accept-Datetime: T ----------------&gt; URI-G\n   4: UA &lt;-- HTTP 302; Location: URI-M; Vary; Link:\n         URI-R,URI-T ------------------------------------------&gt; URI-G\n   5: UA --- HTTP GET URI-M; Accept-Datetime: T ---------------&gt; URI-M\n   6: UA &lt;-- HTTP 200; Memento-Datetime: T; Link:\n         URI-R,URI-T,URI-G ------------------------------------- URI-M\n\n          Figure 2: A Datetime Negotiation Request/Response Chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

In\n            addition, the response contains an HTTP \"Link\" header with a\n            Relation Type of \"original\" pointing at the Original\n            Resource (URI-R), and an HTTP \"Link\" header with a Relation\n            Type of \"timemap\" pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T).\n\n   Step 5:  The user agent issues an HTTP GET request against URI-M.\n\n   Step 6:  The response from URI-M includes a \"Memento-Datetime\" HTTP\n            header with a value of the archival datetime of the Memento.\n            It also contains an HTTP \"Link\" header with a Relation Type\n            of \"original\" pointing at the Original Resource (URI-R),\n            with a Relation Type of \"timegate\" pointing at a TimeGate\n            (URI-G) for the Original Resource, and with a Relation Type\n            of \"timemap\" pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T) for the Original\n            Resource.  The state that is expressed by the response is\n            the state the Original Resource had at the archival datetime\n            expressed in the \"Memento-Datetime\" header.\n\n   In order to respond to a datetime negotiation request, the server\n   uses an internal algorithm to select the Memento that best meets the\n   user agent's datetime preference.  The exact nature of the selection\n   algorithm is at the server's discretion but is intended to be\n   consistent, for example, always selecting the Memento that is nearest\n   in time relative to the requested datetime, always selecting the\n   Memento that is nearest in the past relative to the requested\n   datetime, etc.\n\n   Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most systems, the value of the\n   \"Memento-Datetime\" header returned by a server may differ\n   (significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in \"Accept-\n   Datetime\".\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Various reasons exist why there are significant chances\n   these would be different yet do convey substantially the same\n   information.  These include format migrations as part of a digital\n   preservation strategy, URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives,\n   and the addition of banners as a means to brand Web archives.\n\n   When negotiating in the datetime dimension, the regular content\n   negotiation dimensions (media type, character encoding, language, and\n   compression) remain available.  It is the TimeGate server's\n   responsibility to honor (or not) such content negotiation, and in\n   doing so it MUST always first select a Memento that meets the user\n   agent's datetime preference, and then consider honoring regular\n   content negotiation for it.  As a result of this approach, the\n   returned Memento will not necessarily meet the user agent's regular\n   content negotiation preferences.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that\n   the server provides \"memento\" links in the HTTP \"Link\" header\n   pointing at Mementos that do meet the user agent's regular content\n   negotiation requests and that have a value for the \"Memento-Datetime\"\n   header in the temporal vicinity of the user agent's preferred\n   datetime value.\n\n   A user agent that engages in datetime negotiation with a resource\n   typically starts by issuing an HTTP HEAD, not GET, request with an\n   \"Accept-Datetime\" header in order to determine how to proceed.  This\n   strategy is related to the existence of various server implementation\n   patterns as will become clear in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>.\n\n   Details about the HTTP interactions involved in datetime negotiation\n   are provided in <a href=\"#section-4\">Section 4</a>.\n\n<span><a id=\"section-3.2\" href=\"#section-3.2\">3.2</a>.

Pattern 2 - A Remote Resource Acts as a TimeGate for the Original</span>\n<span>      Resource</span>\n\n   In this implementation pattern, the Original Resource does not act as\n   its own TimeGate, which means that URI-R and URI-G are different.\n   This pattern is typically implemented by servers for which the\n   history of their resources is recorded in remote systems such as Web\n   archives and transactional archives [<a href=\"#ref-Fitch\" title=\"&quot;Web site archiving - an approach to recording every materially different response produced by a website&quot;\">Fitch</a>].  But servers that\n   maintain their own history, such as content management systems and\n   version control systems, may also implement this pattern, for\n   example, to distribute the load involved in responding to requests\n   for current and prior representations of resources between different\n   servers.\n\n   This pattern is summarized in the below table and is detailed in the\n   remainder of this section.  Three cases exist that differ regarding\n   the negotiation style that is used by the remote TimeGate and\n   regarding the existence of a URI-M for Mementos that is distinct from\n   the URI-G of the TimeGate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Pattern 4 - Mementos without a TimeGate</span>\n\n   Cases may occur in which a server hosts Mementos but does not expose\n   a TimeGate for them.  This can, for example, be the case if the\n   server's Mementos result from taking a snapshot of the state of a set\n   of Original Resources from another server as it is being retired.  As\n   a result, only a single Memento per Original Resource is hosted,\n   making the introduction of a TimeGate unnecessary.  But it may also\n   be the case for servers that host multiple Mementos for an Original\n   Resource but consider exposing TimeGates too expensive.  In this\n   case, URI-R and URI-M are distinct, but a TimeGate is absent.  This\n   case is summarized in the below table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Issues with Accept-Datetime</span>\n\n   The following special cases may occur regarding the \"Accept-Datetime\"\n   header when a user agent issues a request against a TimeGate:\n\n   o  If the value of the \"Accept-Datetime\" is either earlier than the\n      datetime of the first Memento or later than the datetime of the\n      most recent Memento known to the TimeGate, the first or most\n      recent Memento MUST be selected, respectively.\n\n   o  If the value of the \"Accept-Datetime\" does not conform to the\n      <a href=\"/doc/html/rfc1123\">rfc1123</a>-date construction rule of the BNF in Figure 1, the\n      response MUST have a \"400 Bad Request\" HTTP status code.\n\n   o  If a user agent issues a request against a TimeGate and fails to\n      include an \"Accept-Datetime\" request header, the most recent\n      Memento SHOULD be selected.\n\n   In all cases, the use of headers and links in responses is as\n   described for TimeGates in the respective scenarios.\n\n<span><a id=\"section-4.5.4\" href=\"#section-4.5.4\">4.5.4</a>.  Memento of a 3XX Response</span>\n\n   Cases exist in which HTTP responses with 3XX status codes are\n   archived.  For example, crawl-based Web archives commonly archive\n   responses with HTTP status codes \"301 Moved Permanently\" and \"302\n   Found\", whereas Linked Data archives hold on to \"303 See Other\"\n   responses.\n\n   If the Memento requested by the user agent is an archived version of\n   an HTTP response with a 3XX status code, the server's response MUST\n   have the same 3XX HTTP status code.  The use of other Memento headers\n   is as described for Mementos in the respective scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

The\n   user agent MUST behave in the same manner as it does with HTTP\n   responses with a 3XX status code that do not have a \"Memento-\n   Datetime\" header.\n\n   However, the user agent MUST be aware that the URI that was selected\n   from the \"Location\" header of an HTTP response with a 3XX status code\n   might not be that of a Memento but rather of an Original Resource.\n   In the latter case, it SHOULD proceed by looking for a Memento of the\n   selected Original Resource.\n\n   For example, Figure 20 shows the response to an HTTP GET request for\n   http://a.example.org issued on April 11, 2008.  This response is\n   archived as a Memento of http://a.example.org that has as URI-M\n   http://arxiv.example.net/web/20080411000650/http://a.example.org.\n   The response to an HTTP GET on this URI-M is shown in Figure 21.  It\n   is a replay of the original response with \"Memento-Datetime\" and\n   \"Link\" headers added, to allow a user agent to understand the\n   response is a Memento.  In Figure 21, the value of the \"Location\"\n   header is the same as in the original response; it identifies an\n   Original Resource.  The user agent proceeds with finding a Memento\n   for this Original Resource.  Web archives sometimes overwrite the\n   value that was originally provided in the \"Location\" header in order\n   to point at a Memento they hold of the resource to which the redirect\n   originally led.  This is shown in Figure 22.  In this case, the user\n   agent may decide it found an appropriate Memento.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n   Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2008 00:06:50 GMT\n   Server: Apache\n   Location: http://b.example.org\n   Content-Length: 0\n   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n                     Figure 20: Response Is a Redirect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Sticky \"Memento-Datetime\" and \"original\" Link for Mementos</span>\n\n   A response to an HTTP HEAD/GET request issued against a Memento:\n\n   o  Includes a \"Memento-Datetime\" header that entails a promise that\n      the response is archived, frozen in time.  The value of the header\n      expresses the archival datetime of the Memento.\n\n   o  Includes a link in the HTTP \"Link\" header with an \"original\"\n      Relation Type that unambiguously points to the Original Resource\n      associated with the Memento.

Intermediate\n   resources commonly exist in Web archives on the path from a TimeGate\n   to an appropriate Memento.\n\n   A response of an intermediate resource has an HTTP status code\n   indicative of HTTP redirection (e.g., 302) and uses Memento headers\n   and links that allow user agents to recognize that the resource plays\n   a role in the Memento framework:\n\n   o  A \"Vary\" header that includes an \"accept-datetime\" value MUST NOT\n      be provided.\n\n   o  The response MUST NOT include a \"Memento-Datetime\" header.\n\n   o  The \"Link\" header MUST be provided, and it MUST have a link with\n      the \"original\" Relation Type that has the URI-R of the associated\n      Original Resource as Target IRI.  Links with \"timegate\",\n      \"timemap\", and \"memento\" Relation Types are OPTIONAL and, if\n      provided, MUST pertain to the Original Resource for which the user\n      agent is trying to obtain a Memento.\n\n   A user agent MUST follow a redirection provided by an intermediate\n   resource; multiple such redirections can be chained.\n\n   Consider the case where a user agent follows the \"timegate\" link\n   provided in Figure 10 and engages in datetime negotiation with the\n   assumed TimeGate in the manner shown in Figure 11.  But instead of\n   receiving a response as shown in Figure 12, it receives the one shown\n   below in Figure 25.  Such a response is unambiguously recognizable as\n   coming from an intermediate resource.\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Resources Excluded from Datetime Negotiation</span>\n\n   When delivering a Memento to a user agent, a Web archive commonly\n   enhances that Memento's archived content, for example, by including a\n   banner that provides branding and highlights the archival status of\n   the Memento.  The resources that are involved in providing such\n   system-specific functionality, many times JavaScript or images, must\n   be used in their current state.\n\n   A server that generally supports datetime negotiation should make\n   resources that need to be excluded from datetime negotiation\n   recognizable.  Doing so allows a user agent to refrain from\n   attempting to access a Memento for them.  In order to achieve this,\n   the server SHOULD include a special-purpose link in the HTTP \"Link\"\n   header when responding to an HTTP HEAD/GET request to a resource\n   excluded from datetime negotiation.  This link has\n   \"http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate\" as Target IRI and\n   \"type\", defined in [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc6903\" title=\"&quot;Additional Link Relation Types&quot;\">RFC6903</a>], as the value of the \"rel\" attribute.\n   Other Memento headers as defined in <a href=\"#section-2.1\">Section 2.1</a> SHOULD NOT be\n   provided.\n\n   Figure 26 shows the response to an HTTP HEAD request from a resource\n   excluded from datetime negotiation.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n   Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2010 00:09:40 GMT\n   Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\n   Link: &lt;<a href=\"http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate\">http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate</a>&gt;; rel=\"type\"\n   Content-Length: 238\n   Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n   Figure 26: Response to an HTTP HEAD Request from a Resource Excluded\n                         from Datetime Negotiation\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

TimeMaps: Content and Serialization</span>\n\n   A TimeMap is introduced to support retrieving a comprehensive list of\n   all Mementos for a specific Original Resource known to a server.  The\n   entity-body of a response to an HTTP GET request issued against a\n   TimeMap's URI-T:\n\n   o  MUST list the URI-R of the Original Resource that the TimeMap is\n      about;\n\n   o  MUST list the URI-M and archival datetime of each Memento for the\n      Original Resource known to the server, preferably in a single\n      document, or, alternatively in multiple documents that can be\n      gathered by following contained links with a \"timemap\" Relation\n      Type;\n\n   o  SHOULD list the URI-G of one or more TimeGates for the Original\n      Resource known to the responding server;\n\n   o  SHOULD, for self-containment, list the URI-T of the TimeMap\n      itself;\n\n   o  MUST unambiguously type listed resources as being Original\n      Resource, TimeGate, Memento, or TimeMap.\n\n   The entity-body of a response from a TimeMap MAY be serialized in\n   various ways, but the link-value format serialization described here\n   MUST be supported.  In this serialization, the entity-body MUST be\n   formatted in the same way as the value of an HTTP \"Link\" header, and\n   hence MUST comply to the \"link-value\" construction rule of <a href=\"#section-5\">Section 5</a>.\n   The Link header field of [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc5988\" title=\"&quot;Web Linking&quot;\">RFC5988</a>], and the media type of the entity-\n   body MUST be \"application/link-format\" as introduced in [<a href=\"/doc/html/rfc6690\" title=\"&quot;Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format&quot;\">RFC6690</a>].\n   Links contained in the entity-body MUST be interpreted as follows:\n\n   o  The Context IRI is set to the anchor parameter, when specified;\n\n   o  The Context IRI of links with the \"self\" Relation Types is the\n      URI-T of the TimeMap, i.e., the URI of the resource from which the\n      TimeMap was requested;\n\n   o  The Context IRI of all other links is the URI-R of the Original\n      Resource, which is provided as the Target IRI of the link with an\n      \"original\" Relation Type.\n\n   In order to retrieve the link-value serialization of a TimeMap, a\n   user agent uses an \"Accept\" request header with a value set to\n   \"application/link-format\".  This is shown in Figure 27.\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Index and Paging TimeMaps</span>\n\n   Cases exist in which a TimeMap points at one or more other TimeMaps:\n\n   o  Index TimeMap - A TimeMap can merely point at other TimeMaps and\n      not list any Mementos itself.  This can happen when Mementos are\n      spread across several archives that share a front-end.  An example\n      is shown in Figure 29.\n\n   o  Paging TimeMap - The number of available Mementos can require\n      introducing multiple TimeMaps that can be paged.  An example is\n      shown in Figure 30.  Note that a Paging TimeMap contains links to\n      other TimeMaps but actually also lists Mementos.\n\n   In both cases, including the \"from\" and \"until\" attributes for\n   \"timemap\" links is RECOMMENDED as a means to express the temporal\n   span of Mementos listed in each TimeMap.  Note that TimeMaps obtained\n   by following a \"timemap\" link can contain links to further TimeMaps.\n\n   &lt;http://a.example.org&gt;;rel=\"original\",\n    &lt;http://arxiv.example.net/timegate/http://a.example.org&gt;\n      ; rel=\"timegate\",\n    &lt;http://arxiv.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org&gt;\n      ; rel=\"self\";type=\"application/link-format\",\n    &lt;http://arxiv1.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org&gt;\n      ; rel=\"timemap\";type=\"application/link-format\"\n      ; from=\"Wed, 21 Jun 2000 04:41:56 GMT\"\n      ; until=\"Wed, 09 Apr 2008 20:30:51 GMT\",\n    &lt;http://arxiv2.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org&gt;\n      ; rel=\"timemap\";type=\"application/link-format\"\n      ; from=\"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 20:30:51 GMT\"\n      ; until=\"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 20:49:54 GMT\",\n    &lt;http://arxiv3.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org&gt;\n      ; rel=\"timemap\";type=\"application/link-format\"\n      ; from=\"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 20:30:51 GMT\"\n\n                         Figure 29: Index TimeMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Mementos for TimeMaps</span>\n\n   A TimeMap itself can act as an Original Resource for which a TimeGate\n   and Mementos may exist.  Hence, the response from a TimeMap could\n   include a \"timegate\" link to a TimeGate via which prior TimeMap\n   versions are available.  And, in cases where URI-T=URI-R=URI-G (a\n   TimeMap is an Original Resource that acts as its own TimeGate), an\n   \"original\" link pointing at the TimeMap URI-T would be included.\n\n   Therefore, caution is required in cases where a TimeMap for an\n   Original Resource wants to explicitly express in a \"Link\" header for\n   which Original Resource it is a TimeMap.  It can do so by including a\n   \"timemap\" link that has the URI-R of the Original Resource as Context\n   IRI and the URI-T of the TimeMap as Target IRI.\n\n   Figure 31 shows the response to an HTTP HEAD request against a\n   TimeMap that has\n   http://arxiv.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org as URI-T.  This\n   TimeMap provides information about Mementos for the Original Resource\n   that has http://a.example.org as URI-R.  The response includes an\n   \"original\" link pointing to the Original Resource that this TimeMap\n   is about.  Note the use of the \"anchor\" attribute in this link to\n   convey the URI-R of that Original Resource.\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

The inclusion of this Link when\n   requesting authentication is at the server's discretion; cases may\n   exist in which a server protects the current state of a resource, but\n   supports open access to prior states and thus chooses to supply this\n   HTTP \"Link\" header.  Conversely, the server may choose to not\n   advertise the TimeGate URIs (e.g., they exist in an intranet archive)\n   for unauthenticated requests.\n\n   The veracity of archives and the relationships between Original\n   Resources and Mementos is beyond the scope of this document.  Even in\n   the absence of malice, it is possible for separate archives to have\n   different Mementos for the same Original Resource at the same\n   datetime if the state of the Original Resource was dependent on the\n   requesting archive's user agent IP address, specific HTTP request\n   headers, and possibly other factors.\n\n   Further authentication, encryption, and other security-related issues\n   are otherwise orthogonal to Memento.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Van de Sompel, et al.

Datetime\n   negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the\n   given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps\n   are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior\n   states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates\n   recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of\n   another resource.\n\nStatus of This Memo\n\n   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational purposes.\n\n   This is a contribution to the RFC Series, independently of any other\n   RFC stream.

Terminology\n\n   This specification uses the terms \"resource\", \"request\", \"response\",\n   \"entity-body\", \"content negotiation\", \"user agent\", and \"server\" as\n   described in [RFC2616], and it uses the terms \"representation\" and\n   \"resource state\" as described in [W3C.REC-aww-20041215].\n\n   In addition, the following terms specific to the Memento framework\n   are introduced:\n\n   o  Original Resource: An Original Resource is a resource that exists\n      or used to exist, and for which access to one of its prior states\n      may be required.\n\n   o  Memento: A Memento for an Original Resource is a resource that\n      encapsulates a prior state of the Original Resource.  A Memento\n      for an Original Resource as it existed at time T is a resource\n      that encapsulates the state the Original Resource had at time T.\n\n   o  TimeGate: A TimeGate for an Original Resource is a resource that\n      is capable of datetime negotiation to support access to prior\n      states of the Original Resource.\n\n   o  TimeMap: A TimeMap for an Original Resource is a resource from\n      which a list of URIs of Mementos of the Original Resource is\n      available.\n\n1.2.  Notational Conventions\n\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\n   When needed for extra clarity, the following conventions are used:\n\n   o  URI-R is used to denote the URI of an Original Resource.\n\n   o  URI-G is used to denote the URI of a TimeGate.\n\n   o  URI-M is used to denote the URI of a Memento.\n\n   o  URI-T is used to denote the URI of a TimeMap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                     [Page 4]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n1.3.  Purpose\n\n   The state of an Original Resource may change over time.\n   Dereferencing its URI at any specific moment yields a response that\n   reflects the resource's state at that moment: a representation of the\n   resource's state (e.g., \"200 OK\" HTTP status code), an indication of\n   its nonexistence (e.g., \"404 Not Found\" HTTP status code), a relation\n   to another resource (e.g., \"302 Found\" HTTP status code), etc.\n   However, responses may also exist that reflect prior states of an\n   Original Resource: a representation of a prior state of the Original\n   Resource, an indication that the Original Resource did not exist at\n   some time in the past, a relation that the Original Resource had to\n   another resource at some time in the past, etc.  Mementos that\n   provide such responses exist in Web archives, content management\n   systems, or revision control systems, among others.  For any given\n   Original Resource several Mementos may exist, each one reflecting a\n   frozen prior state of the Original Resource.\n\n   Examples are:\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource http://www.ietf.org/ are as follows:\n\n   o  http://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/\n\n   o  http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://\n      www.ietf.org/\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource\n   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol are as\n   follows:\n\n   o  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/\n      index.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&oldid=366806574\n\n   o  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/\n      index.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&oldid=33912\n\n   o  http://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/\n      wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\n\n   Mementos for Original Resource http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/ are as\n   follows:\n\n   o  http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/\n\n   o  http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/\n\n   o  http://archive.is/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                     [Page 5]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   In the abstract, the Memento framework introduces a mechanism to\n   access versions of Web resources that:\n\n   o  Is fully distributed in the sense that resource versions may\n      reside on multiple servers, and that any such server is likely\n      only aware of the versions it holds;\n\n   o  Uses the global notion of datetime as a resource version indicator\n      and access key;\n\n   o  Leverages the following primitives of [W3C.REC-aww-20041215]:\n      resource, resource state, representation, content negotiation, and\n      link.\n\n   The core components of Memento's mechanism to access resource\n   versions are:\n\n   1.  The abstract notion of the state of an Original Resource (URI-R)\n       as it existed at datetime T.  Note the relationship with the\n       ability to identify the state of a resource at datetime T by\n       means of a URI as intended by the proposed Dated URI scheme\n       [DATED-URI].\n\n   2.  A \"bridge\" from the present to the past, consisting of:\n\n       o  The existence of a TimeGate (URI-G), which is aware of (at\n          least part of the) version history of the Original Resource\n          (URI-R);\n\n       o  The ability to negotiate in the datetime dimension with that\n          TimeGate (URI-G), as a means to access the state that the\n          Original Resource (URI-R) had at datetime T.\n\n   3.  A \"bridge\" from the past to the present, consisting of an\n       appropriately typed link from a Memento (URI-M), which\n       encapsulates the state the Original Resource (URI-R) had at\n       datetime T, to the Original Resource (URI-R).\n\n   4.  The existence of a TimeMap (URI-T) from which a list of all\n       Mementos that encapsulate a prior state of the Original Resource\n       (URI-R) can be obtained.\n\n   This document is concerned with specifying an instantiation of these\n   abstractions for resources that are identified by HTTP(S) URIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                     [Page 6]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n2.  HTTP Headers, Link Relation Types\n\n   The Memento framework is concerned with HEAD and GET interactions\n   with Original Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps that are\n   identified by HTTP or HTTPS URIs.  Details are only provided for\n   resources identified by HTTP URIs but apply similarly to those with\n   HTTPS URIs.\n\n2.1.  HTTP Headers\n\n   The Memento framework operates at the level of HTTP request and\n   response headers.  It introduces two new headers (\"Accept-Datetime\"\n   and \"Memento-Datetime\") and introduces new values for two existing\n   headers (\"Vary\" and \"Link\").  Other HTTP headers are present or\n   absent in Memento response/request cycles as specified by [RFC2616].\n\n2.1.1.  Accept-Datetime and Memento-Datetime\n\n   The \"Accept-Datetime\" request header is transmitted by a user agent\n   to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource.\n   To that end, the \"Accept-Datetime\" header is conveyed in an HTTP\n   request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its\n   value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the\n   Original Resource.\n\n   Example of an \"Accept-Datetime\" request header:\n\n   Accept-Datetime: Thu, 31 May 2007 20:35:00 GMT\n\n   The \"Memento-Datetime\" response header is used by a server to\n   indicate that a response reflects a prior state of an Original\n   Resource.  Its value expresses the datetime of that state.  The URI\n   of the Original Resource for which the response reflects a prior\n   state is provided as the Target IRI of a link provided in the HTTP\n   \"Link\" header that has a Relation Type of \"original\" (see\n   Section 2.2).\n\n   The presence of a \"Memento-Datetime\" header and associated value for\n   a given response constitutes a promise that the resource state\n   reflected in the response will no longer change (see Section 4.5.6).\n\n   Example of a \"Memento-Datetime\" response header:\n\n   Memento-Datetime: Wed, 30 May 2007 18:47:52 GMT\n\n   Values for the \"Accept-Datetime\" and \"Memento-Datetime\" headers\n   consist of a MANDATORY datetime expressed according to the [RFC1123]\n   format, which is formalized by the rfc1123-date construction rule of\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                     [Page 7]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   the BNF in Figure 1.  This BNF is derived from the HTTP-date\n   construction of the BNF for Full Dates provided in [RFC2616].  The\n   datetime is case sensitive with names for days and months exactly as\n   shown in the wkday and month construction rules of the BNF,\n   respectively.  The datetime MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean\n   Time (GMT).\n\n   accept-dt-value = rfc1123-date\n   rfc1123-date = wkday \",\" SP date1 SP time SP \"GMT\"\n   date1        = 2DIGIT SP month SP 4DIGIT\n                     ; day month year (e.g., 20 Mar 1957)\n   time         = 2DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT\n                     ; 00:00:00 - 23:59:59 (e.g., 14:33:22)\n   wkday        = \"Mon\" | \"Tue\" | \"Wed\" | \"Thu\" | \"Fri\" | \"Sat\" |\n                  \"Sun\"\n   month        = \"Jan\" | \"Feb\" | \"Mar\" | \"Apr\" | \"May\" | \"Jun\" |\n                  \"Jul\" | \"Aug\" | \"Sep\" | \"Oct\" | \"Nov\" | \"Dec\"\n\n                   Figure 1: BNF for the Datetime Format\n\n2.1.2.  Vary\n\n   Generally, the \"Vary\" header is used in HTTP responses to indicate\n   the dimensions in which content negotiation is possible.  In the\n   Memento framework, a TimeGate uses the \"Vary\" header with a value\n   that includes \"accept-datetime\" to convey that datetime negotiation\n   is possible.\n\n   For example, this use of the \"Vary\" header indicates that datetime is\n   the only dimension in which negotiation is possible:\n\n   Vary: accept-datetime\n\n   The use of the \"Vary\" header in this example shows that both datetime\n   negotiation and media type content negotiation are possible:\n\n   Vary: accept-datetime, accept\n\n2.1.3.  Link\n\n   The Memento framework defines the \"original\", \"timegate\", \"timemap\",\n   and \"memento\" Relation Types to convey typed links among Original\n   Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps.  They are defined in\n   Section 2.2, below.  In addition, existing Relation Types may be\n   used, for example, to support navigating among Mementos.  Examples\n   are \"first\", \"last\", \"prev\", \"next\", \"predecessor-version\", and\n   \"successor-version\" as detailed in [RFC5988] and [RFC5829].\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                     [Page 8]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n2.2.  Link Relation Types\n\n   This section introduces the Relation Types used in the Memento\n   framework.  They are defined in a general way, and their use in HTTP\n   \"Link\" headers [RFC5988] is described in detail.  The use of these\n   Relation Types in TimeMaps is described in Section 5.\n\n2.2.1.  Link Relation Type \"original\"\n\n   \"original\" -- A link with an \"original\" Relation Type is used to\n   point from a TimeGate or a Memento to its associated Original\n   Resource.\n\n   Use in HTTP \"Link\" headers: Responses to HTTP HEAD/GET requests\n   issued against a TimeGate or a Memento MUST include exactly one link\n   with an \"original\" Relation Type in their HTTP \"Link\" header.\n\n2.2.2.  Link Relation Type \"timegate\"\n\n   \"timegate\" -- A link with a \"timegate\" Relation Type is used to point\n   from the Original Resource, as well as from a Memento associated with\n   the Original Resource, to a TimeGate for the Original Resource.\n\n   Use in HTTP \"Link\" headers: If there is a TimeGate associated with an\n   Original Resource or Memento that is preferred for use, then\n   responses to HTTP HEAD/GET requests issued against these latter\n   resources MUST include a link with a \"timegate\" Relation Type in\n   their HTTP \"Link\" header.  Since multiple TimeGates can exist for any\n   Original Resource, multiple \"timegate\" links MAY occur, each with a\n   distinct Target IRI.\n\n2.2.3.  Link Relation Type \"timemap\"\n\n   \"timemap\" -- A link with a \"timemap\" Relation Type is used to point\n   from a TimeGate or a Memento associated with an Original Resource, as\n   well as from the Original Resource itself, to a TimeMap for the\n   Original Resource.\n\n   Attributes: A link with a \"timemap\" Relation Type SHOULD use the\n   \"type\" attribute to convey the MIME type of the TimeMap\n   serialization.  The \"from\" and \"until\" attributes may be used to\n   express the start and end of the temporal interval covered by\n   Mementos listed in the TimeMap.  That is, the linked TimeMap will not\n   contain Mementos with archival datetimes outside of the expressed\n   temporal interval.  Attempts SHOULD be made to convey this interval\n   as accurately as possible.  The value for the these attributes MUST\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                     [Page 9]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   be a datetime expressed according to the rfc1123-date construction\n   rule of the BNF in Figure 1, and it MUST be represented in Greenwich\n   Mean Time (GMT).\n\n   Use in HTTP \"Link\" headers: If there is a TimeMap associated with an\n   Original Resource, a TimeGate, or a Memento that is preferred for\n   use, then responses to HTTP HEAD/GET requests issued against these\n   latter resources MUST include a link with a \"timemap\" Relation Type\n   in their HTTP \"Link\" header.  Multiple such links, each with a\n   distinct Target IRI, MAY be expressed as a means to point to\n   different TimeMaps or to different serializations of the same\n   TimeMap.  In all cases, use of the \"from\" and \"until\" attributes is\n   OPTIONAL.\n\n2.2.4.  Link Relation Type \"memento\"\n\n   \"memento\" -- A link with a \"memento\" Relation Type is used to point\n   from a TimeGate or a Memento for an Original Resource, as well as\n   from the Original Resource itself, to a Memento for the Original\n   Resource.\n\n   Attributes: A link with a \"memento\" Relation Type MUST include a\n   \"datetime\" attribute with a value that matches the \"Memento-Datetime\"\n   of the Memento that is the target of the link; that is, the value of\n   the \"Memento-Datetime\" header that is returned when the URI of the\n   linked Memento is dereferenced.  The value for the \"datetime\"\n   attribute MUST be a datetime expressed according to the rfc1123-date\n   construction rule of the BNF in Figure 1, and it MUST be represented\n   in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  This link MAY include a \"license\"\n   attribute to associate a license with the Memento; the value for the\n   \"license\" attribute MUST be a URI.\n\n   Use in HTTP \"Link\" headers: Responses to HTTP HEAD/GET requests\n   issued against an Original Resource, a TimeGate, and a Memento MAY\n   include links in their HTTP \"Link\" headers with a \"memento\" Relation\n   Type.  For responses in which a Memento is selected, the provision of\n   navigational links that lead to Mementos other than the selected one\n   can be beneficial to the user agent.  Of special importance are links\n   that lead to the temporally first and last Memento known to the\n   responding server, as well as links leading to Mementos that are\n   temporally adjacent to the selected one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 10]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n3.  Overview of the Memento Framework\n\n   The Memento framework defines two complementary approaches to support\n   obtaining representations of prior states of an Original Resource:\n\n   o  Datetime Negotiation: Datetime negotiation is a variation on\n      content negotiation by which a user agent expresses a datetime\n      preference pertaining to the representation of an Original\n      Resource, instead of, for example, a media type preference.  Based\n      on the responding server's knowledge of the past of the Original\n      Resource, it selects a Memento of the Original Resource that best\n      meets the user agent's datetime preference.  An overview is\n      provided in Section 3.1; details are in Section 4.\n\n   o  TimeMaps: A TimeMap is a resource from which a list can be\n      obtained that provides a comprehensive overview of the past of an\n      Original Resource.  A server makes a TimeMap available that\n      enumerates all Mementos that the server is aware of, along with\n      their archival datetime.  A user agent can obtain the TimeMap and\n      select Mementos from it.  An overview is provided in Section 3.2;\n      details are in Section 5.\n\n3.1.  Datetime Negotiation\n\n   Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of a successful request/\n   response chain that involves datetime negotiation.  Dashed lines\n   depict HTTP transactions between user agent and server.  The\n   interactions are for a scenario where the Original Resource resides\n   on one server, whereas both its TimeGate and Mementos reside on\n   another (Pattern 2.1 (Section 4.2.1) in Section 4).

In\n            addition, the response contains an HTTP \"Link\" header with a\n            Relation Type of \"original\" pointing at the Original\n            Resource (URI-R), and an HTTP \"Link\" header with a Relation\n            Type of \"timemap\" pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T).\n\n   Step 5:  The user agent issues an HTTP GET request against URI-M.\n\n   Step 6:  The response from URI-M includes a \"Memento-Datetime\" HTTP\n            header with a value of the archival datetime of the Memento.\n            It also contains an HTTP \"Link\" header with a Relation Type\n            of \"original\" pointing at the Original Resource (URI-R),\n            with a Relation Type of \"timegate\" pointing at a TimeGate\n            (URI-G) for the Original Resource, and with a Relation Type\n            of \"timemap\" pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T) for the Original\n            Resource.  The state that is expressed by the response is\n            the state the Original Resource had at the archival datetime\n            expressed in the \"Memento-Datetime\" header.\n\n   In order to respond to a datetime negotiation request, the server\n   uses an internal algorithm to select the Memento that best meets the\n   user agent's datetime preference.  The exact nature of the selection\n   algorithm is at the server's discretion but is intended to be\n   consistent, for example, always selecting the Memento that is nearest\n   in time relative to the requested datetime, always selecting the\n   Memento that is nearest in the past relative to the requested\n   datetime, etc.\n\n   Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most systems, the value of the\n   \"Memento-Datetime\" header returned by a server may differ\n   (significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in \"Accept-\n   Datetime\".\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 12]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   Although a Memento encapsulates a prior state of an Original\n   Resource, the entity-body returned in response to an HTTP GET request\n   issued against a Memento may very well not be byte-to-byte the same\n   as an entity-body that was previously returned by that Original\n   Resource.  Various reasons exist why there are significant chances\n   these would be different yet do convey substantially the same\n   information.  These include format migrations as part of a digital\n   preservation strategy, URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives,\n   and the addition of banners as a means to brand Web archives.\n\n   When negotiating in the datetime dimension, the regular content\n   negotiation dimensions (media type, character encoding, language, and\n   compression) remain available.  It is the TimeGate server's\n   responsibility to honor (or not) such content negotiation, and in\n   doing so it MUST always first select a Memento that meets the user\n   agent's datetime preference, and then consider honoring regular\n   content negotiation for it.  As a result of this approach, the\n   returned Memento will not necessarily meet the user agent's regular\n   content negotiation preferences.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that\n   the server provides \"memento\" links in the HTTP \"Link\" header\n   pointing at Mementos that do meet the user agent's regular content\n   negotiation requests and that have a value for the \"Memento-Datetime\"\n   header in the temporal vicinity of the user agent's preferred\n   datetime value.\n\n   A user agent that engages in datetime negotiation with a resource\n   typically starts by issuing an HTTP HEAD, not GET, request with an\n   \"Accept-Datetime\" header in order to determine how to proceed.  This\n   strategy is related to the existence of various server implementation\n   patterns as will become clear in Section 4.\n\n   Details about the HTTP interactions involved in datetime negotiation\n   are provided in Section 4.\n\n3.2.  TimeMaps\n\n   Figure 3 provides a schematic overview of a successful request/\n   response chain that shows a user agent obtaining a TimeMap.  The\n   pictorial conventions are the same as the ones used in Figure 2, as\n   is the scenario.  Note that, in addition to a TimeGate, an Original\n   Resource and a Memento can also provide a link to a TimeMap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Datetime Negotiation: HTTP Interactions\n\n   Figure 2 depicts a specific pattern to implement the Memento\n   framework.  Multiple patterns exist, and they can be grouped as\n   follows:\n\n   o  Pattern 1 (Section 4.1) - The Original Resource acts as its own\n      TimeGate\n\n   o  Pattern 2 (Section 4.2) - A remote resource acts as a TimeGate for\n      the Original Resource\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 14]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   o  Pattern 3 (Section 4.3) - The Original Resource is a Fixed\n      Resource\n\n   o  Pattern 4 (Section 4.4) - Mementos without a TimeGate\n\n   Details of the HTTP interactions for common cases for each of those\n   patterns are provided in Sections 4.1 through 4.4.  Appendix A\n   summarizes the use of the \"Vary\", \"Memento-Datetime\", and \"Link\"\n   headers in responses from Original Resources, TimeGates, and Mementos\n   for the various patterns.  Special cases are described in\n   Section 4.5.  Note that in the following sections, the HTTP status\n   code of the responses with an entity-body is shown as \"200 OK\", but a\n   series of \"206 Partial Content\" responses could be substituted.\n\n   Figure 4 shows a user agent that attempts to datetime negotiate with\n   the Original Resource http://a.example.org/ by including an \"Accept-\n   Datetime\" header in its HTTP HEAD request.  This initiating request\n   is the same for Pattern 1 (Section 4.1) through Pattern 3\n   (Section 4.3).\n\n   HEAD / HTTP/1.1\n   Host: a.example.org\n   Accept-Datetime: Tue, 20 Mar 2001 20:35:00 GMT\n   Connection: close\n\n            Figure 4: User Agent Attempts Datetime Negotiation\n                          with Original Resource\n\n4.1.  Pattern 1 - The Original Resource Acts as Its Own TimeGate\n\n   In this implementation pattern, the Original Resource acts as its own\n   TimeGate, which means that URI-R and URI-G coincide.  Content\n   management systems and revision control systems can support datetime\n   negotiation in this way as they are commonly aware of the version\n   history of their own resources.\n\n   The response to this request when datetime negotiation for this\n   resource is supported depends on the negotiation style it uses (200-\n   style or 302-style) and on the existence or absence of a URI-M for\n   Mementos that is distinct from the URI-R of the associated Original\n   Resource.  The various cases are summarized in the below table, and\n   the server responses for each are detailed in the remainder of this\n   section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Pattern 2 - A Remote Resource Acts as a TimeGate for the Original\n      Resource\n\n   In this implementation pattern, the Original Resource does not act as\n   its own TimeGate, which means that URI-R and URI-G are different.\n   This pattern is typically implemented by servers for which the\n   history of their resources is recorded in remote systems such as Web\n   archives and transactional archives [Fitch].  But servers that\n   maintain their own history, such as content management systems and\n   version control systems, may also implement this pattern, for\n   example, to distribute the load involved in responding to requests\n   for current and prior representations of resources between different\n   servers.\n\n   This pattern is summarized in the below table and is detailed in the\n   remainder of this section.  Three cases exist that differ regarding\n   the negotiation style that is used by the remote TimeGate and\n   regarding the existence of a URI-M for Mementos that is distinct from\n   the URI-G of the TimeGate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Pattern 3 - The Original Resource is a Fixed Resource\n\n   This pattern does not involve datetime negotiation with a TimeGate,\n   but it can be implemented for Original Resources that never change\n   state or do not change anymore past a certain point in their\n   existence, meaning that URI-R and URI-M coincide either from the\n   outset or starting at some point in time.  This pattern is summarized\n   in the below table.  Examples are tweets or stable media resources on\n   news sites.\n\n   +----------+----------------+----------+---------+------------------+\n   |  Pattern |    Original    | TimeGate | Memento |    Negotiation   |\n   |          |    Resource    |          |         |       Style      |\n   +----------+----------------+----------+---------+------------------+\n   |  Pattern |      URI-R     |     -    |  URI-R  |         -        |\n   |     3    |                |          |         |                  |\n   +----------+----------------+----------+---------+------------------+\n\n                            Table 3: Pattern 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

The use of Memento response\n   headers and links in responses from such a stable resource is as\n   follows:\n\n   o  A \"Vary\" header that includes an \"accept-datetime\" value MUST NOT\n      be provided.\n\n   o  The response MUST include a \"Memento-Datetime\" header.  Its value\n      expresses the datetime at which the resource became stable.\n      Providing this value includes a promise that the resource has not\n      changed since this datetime and will not change anymore beyond it.\n\n   o  The \"Link\" header MUST be provided and MUST have a link with the\n      \"original\" Relation Type that has the URI-R of the stable resource\n      itself as Target IRI.\n\n   Figure 17 shows a response to an HTTP HEAD request for the resource\n   with URI-R http://a.example.org/ that has been stable since March 20,\n   2009.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n   Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2010 00:09:40 GMT\n   Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\n   Memento-Datetime: Fri, 20 Mar 2009 11:00:00 GMT\n   Link: <http://a.example.org/>; rel=\"original\"\n   Content-Length: 875\n   Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8\n   Connection: close\n\n            Figure 17: Response from URI-R=URI-M for Pattern 3\n\n4.4.  Pattern 4 - Mementos without a TimeGate\n\n   Cases may occur in which a server hosts Mementos but does not expose\n   a TimeGate for them.  This can, for example, be the case if the\n   server's Mementos result from taking a snapshot of the state of a set\n   of Original Resources from another server as it is being retired.  As\n   a result, only a single Memento per Original Resource is hosted,\n   making the introduction of a TimeGate unnecessary.  But it may also\n   be the case for servers that host multiple Mementos for an Original\n   Resource but consider exposing TimeGates too expensive.  In this\n   case, URI-R and URI-M are distinct, but a TimeGate is absent.  This\n   case is summarized in the below table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Their use is as follows for a response from URI-M:\n\n   o  A \"Vary\" header that includes an \"accept-datetime\" value MUST NOT\n      be provided.\n\n   o  The response MUST include a \"Memento-Datetime\" header.  Its value\n      expresses the archival datetime of the Memento.\n\n   o  The \"Link\" header MUST be provided, and it MUST have a link with\n      the \"original\" Relation Type that has the URI-R of the associated\n      Original Resource as Target IRI.  The provision of other links is\n      encouraged and is subject to the considerations described in\n      Section 2.2.\n\n   Figure 18 shows a response to an HTTP HEAD request for the Memento\n   with URI-M\n   http://arxiv.example.net/web/20010321203610/http://a.example.org/.\n   Note the use of links: three links have the URI-M of the Memento as\n   Target IRI and have respective Relation Types \"memento\", \"first\", and\n   \"last\".  This combination indicates that this is the only Memento for\n   the Original Resource with Target IRI provided by the \"original\" link\n   (http://a.example.org/) of which the server is aware.  Note also that\n   such a response does not imply that there is no server whatsoever\n   that exposes a TimeGate; it merely means that the responding server\n   neither provides nor is aware of the location of a TimeGate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Server Exists but Original Resource No Longer Does\n\n   Cases exist in which the server knows that an Original Resource used\n   to exist, but no longer provides a current representation.  If there\n   is a preferred TimeGate for such a discontinued Original Resource,\n   then the server MUST include a \"timegate\" link in responses to\n   requests for it.

Issues with Accept-Datetime\n\n   The following special cases may occur regarding the \"Accept-Datetime\"\n   header when a user agent issues a request against a TimeGate:\n\n   o  If the value of the \"Accept-Datetime\" is either earlier than the\n      datetime of the first Memento or later than the datetime of the\n      most recent Memento known to the TimeGate, the first or most\n      recent Memento MUST be selected, respectively.\n\n   o  If the value of the \"Accept-Datetime\" does not conform to the\n      rfc1123-date construction rule of the BNF in Figure 1, the\n      response MUST have a \"400 Bad Request\" HTTP status code.\n\n   o  If a user agent issues a request against a TimeGate and fails to\n      include an \"Accept-Datetime\" request header, the most recent\n      Memento SHOULD be selected.\n\n   In all cases, the use of headers and links in responses is as\n   described for TimeGates in the respective scenarios.\n\n4.5.4.  Memento of a 3XX Response\n\n   Cases exist in which HTTP responses with 3XX status codes are\n   archived.  For example, crawl-based Web archives commonly archive\n   responses with HTTP status codes \"301 Moved Permanently\" and \"302\n   Found\", whereas Linked Data archives hold on to \"303 See Other\"\n   responses.\n\n   If the Memento requested by the user agent is an archived version of\n   an HTTP response with a 3XX status code, the server's response MUST\n   have the same 3XX HTTP status code.  The use of other Memento headers\n   is as described for Mementos in the respective scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 30]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   The user agent's handling of an HTTP response with a 3XX status code\n   is not affected by the presence of a \"Memento-Datetime\" header.  The\n   user agent MUST behave in the same manner as it does with HTTP\n   responses with a 3XX status code that do not have a \"Memento-\n   Datetime\" header.\n\n   However, the user agent MUST be aware that the URI that was selected\n   from the \"Location\" header of an HTTP response with a 3XX status code\n   might not be that of a Memento but rather of an Original Resource.\n   In the latter case, it SHOULD proceed by looking for a Memento of the\n   selected Original Resource.\n\n   For example, Figure 20 shows the response to an HTTP GET request for\n   http://a.example.org issued on April 11, 2008.  This response is\n   archived as a Memento of http://a.example.org that has as URI-M\n   http://arxiv.example.net/web/20080411000650/http://a.example.org.\n   The response to an HTTP GET on this URI-M is shown in Figure 21.  It\n   is a replay of the original response with \"Memento-Datetime\" and\n   \"Link\" headers added, to allow a user agent to understand the\n   response is a Memento.  In Figure 21, the value of the \"Location\"\n   header is the same as in the original response; it identifies an\n   Original Resource.  The user agent proceeds with finding a Memento\n   for this Original Resource.  Web archives sometimes overwrite the\n   value that was originally provided in the \"Location\" header in order\n   to point at a Memento they hold of the resource to which the redirect\n   originally led.  This is shown in Figure 22.  In this case, the user\n   agent may decide it found an appropriate Memento.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n   Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2008 00:06:50 GMT\n   Server: Apache\n   Location: http://b.example.org\n   Content-Length: 0\n   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n                     Figure 20: Response Is a Redirect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Memento of Responses with 4XX or 5XX HTTP Status Codes\n\n   Cases exist in which responses with 4XX and 5XX HTTP status codes are\n   archived.  If the Memento requested by the user agent is an archived\n   version of such an HTTP response, the server's response MUST have the\n   same 4XX or 5XX HTTP status code.  The use of headers and links in\n   responses is as described for Mementos in the respective scenarios.\n\n   For example, Figure 23 shows the 404 response to an HTTP GET request\n   for http://a.example.org issued on April 11, 2008.  This response is\n   archived as a Memento of http://a.example.org that has as URI-M\n   http://arxiv.example.net/web/20080411000650/http://a.example.org.\n   The response to an HTTP HEAD on this URI-M is shown in Figure 24.

Sticky \"Memento-Datetime\" and \"original\" Link for Mementos\n\n   A response to an HTTP HEAD/GET request issued against a Memento:\n\n   o  Includes a \"Memento-Datetime\" header that entails a promise that\n      the response is archived, frozen in time.  The value of the header\n      expresses the archival datetime of the Memento.\n\n   o  Includes a link in the HTTP \"Link\" header with an \"original\"\n      Relation Type that unambiguously points to the Original Resource\n      associated with the Memento.  The Target IRI of the link is the\n      URI-R of that Original Resource.\n\n   Both the \"Memento-Datetime\" header and the \"original\" link MUST be\n   \"sticky\" in the following ways:\n\n   o  The server that originally assigns them MUST retain them in all\n      responses to HTTP requests (with or without an \"Accept-Datetime\"\n      request header) that occur against the Memento after the time of\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 33]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n      their original assignment, and the server MUST NOT change the\n      value of the \"Memento-Datetime\" header nor the Target IRI of the\n      \"original\" link.\n\n   o  Applications that mirror Mementos at a different URI MUST retain\n      them and MUST NOT change them unless mirroring involves a\n      meaningful state change.  This allows, among others, duplicating a\n      Web archive at a new location while preserving the value of the\n      \"Memento-Datetime\" header and the link with the \"original\"\n      Relation Type for the archived resources.  For example, when\n      mirroring, the \"Last-Modified\" header will be updated to reflect\n      the time of mirroring at the new URI, whereas the value for\n      \"Memento-Datetime\" will be maintained.\n\n4.5.7.  Intermediate Resources\n\n   An intermediate resource is a resource that issues a redirect to a\n   TimeGate, to a Memento, or to another intermediate resource, and thus\n   plays an active role in the Memento infrastructure.  Intermediate\n   resources commonly exist in Web archives on the path from a TimeGate\n   to an appropriate Memento.\n\n   A response of an intermediate resource has an HTTP status code\n   indicative of HTTP redirection (e.g., 302) and uses Memento headers\n   and links that allow user agents to recognize that the resource plays\n   a role in the Memento framework:\n\n   o  A \"Vary\" header that includes an \"accept-datetime\" value MUST NOT\n      be provided.\n\n   o  The response MUST NOT include a \"Memento-Datetime\" header.\n\n   o  The \"Link\" header MUST be provided, and it MUST have a link with\n      the \"original\" Relation Type that has the URI-R of the associated\n      Original Resource as Target IRI.  Links with \"timegate\",\n      \"timemap\", and \"memento\" Relation Types are OPTIONAL and, if\n      provided, MUST pertain to the Original Resource for which the user\n      agent is trying to obtain a Memento.\n\n   A user agent MUST follow a redirection provided by an intermediate\n   resource; multiple such redirections can be chained.\n\n   Consider the case where a user agent follows the \"timegate\" link\n   provided in Figure 10 and engages in datetime negotiation with the\n   assumed TimeGate in the manner shown in Figure 11.  But instead of\n   receiving a response as shown in Figure 12, it receives the one shown\n   below in Figure 25.  Such a response is unambiguously recognizable as\n   coming from an intermediate resource.\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 34]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   HTTP/1.1 302 Found\n   Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2010 00:06:50 GMT\n   Server: Apache\n   Location:\n    http://arxiv.example.net/new-timegate/http://a.example.org/\n   Link: <http://a.example.org>; rel=\"original\"\n   Content-Length: 0\n   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n          Figure 25: Redirecting Resource Redirects to a TimeGate\n\n4.5.8.  Resources Excluded from Datetime Negotiation\n\n   When delivering a Memento to a user agent, a Web archive commonly\n   enhances that Memento's archived content, for example, by including a\n   banner that provides branding and highlights the archival status of\n   the Memento.  The resources that are involved in providing such\n   system-specific functionality, many times JavaScript or images, must\n   be used in their current state.\n\n   A server that generally supports datetime negotiation should make\n   resources that need to be excluded from datetime negotiation\n   recognizable.  Doing so allows a user agent to refrain from\n   attempting to access a Memento for them.  In order to achieve this,\n   the server SHOULD include a special-purpose link in the HTTP \"Link\"\n   header when responding to an HTTP HEAD/GET request to a resource\n   excluded from datetime negotiation.  This link has\n   \"http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate\" as Target IRI and\n   \"type\", defined in [RFC6903], as the value of the \"rel\" attribute.\n   Other Memento headers as defined in Section 2.1 SHOULD NOT be\n   provided.\n\n   Figure 26 shows the response to an HTTP HEAD request from a resource\n   excluded from datetime negotiation.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n   Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2010 00:09:40 GMT\n   Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\n   Link: <http://mementoweb.org/terms/donotnegotiate>; rel=\"type\"\n   Content-Length: 238\n   Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8\n   Connection: close\n\n   Figure 26: Response to an HTTP HEAD Request from a Resource Excluded\n                         from Datetime Negotiation\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

TimeMaps: Content and Serialization\n\n   A TimeMap is introduced to support retrieving a comprehensive list of\n   all Mementos for a specific Original Resource known to a server.  The\n   entity-body of a response to an HTTP GET request issued against a\n   TimeMap's URI-T:\n\n   o  MUST list the URI-R of the Original Resource that the TimeMap is\n      about;\n\n   o  MUST list the URI-M and archival datetime of each Memento for the\n      Original Resource known to the server, preferably in a single\n      document, or, alternatively in multiple documents that can be\n      gathered by following contained links with a \"timemap\" Relation\n      Type;\n\n   o  SHOULD list the URI-G of one or more TimeGates for the Original\n      Resource known to the responding server;\n\n   o  SHOULD, for self-containment, list the URI-T of the TimeMap\n      itself;\n\n   o  MUST unambiguously type listed resources as being Original\n      Resource, TimeGate, Memento, or TimeMap.\n\n   The entity-body of a response from a TimeMap MAY be serialized in\n   various ways, but the link-value format serialization described here\n   MUST be supported.  In this serialization, the entity-body MUST be\n   formatted in the same way as the value of an HTTP \"Link\" header, and\n   hence MUST comply to the \"link-value\" construction rule of Section 5.\n   The Link header field of [RFC5988], and the media type of the entity-\n   body MUST be \"application/link-format\" as introduced in [RFC6690].\n   Links contained in the entity-body MUST be interpreted as follows:\n\n   o  The Context IRI is set to the anchor parameter, when specified;\n\n   o  The Context IRI of links with the \"self\" Relation Types is the\n      URI-T of the TimeMap, i.e., the URI of the resource from which the\n      TimeMap was requested;\n\n   o  The Context IRI of all other links is the URI-R of the Original\n      Resource, which is provided as the Target IRI of the link with an\n      \"original\" Relation Type.\n\n   In order to retrieve the link-value serialization of a TimeMap, a\n   user agent uses an \"Accept\" request header with a value set to\n   \"application/link-format\".  This is shown in Figure 27.\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Index and Paging TimeMaps\n\n   Cases exist in which a TimeMap points at one or more other TimeMaps:\n\n   o  Index TimeMap - A TimeMap can merely point at other TimeMaps and\n      not list any Mementos itself.  This can happen when Mementos are\n      spread across several archives that share a front-end.  An example\n      is shown in Figure 29.\n\n   o  Paging TimeMap - The number of available Mementos can require\n      introducing multiple TimeMaps that can be paged.  An example is\n      shown in Figure 30.  Note that a Paging TimeMap contains links to\n      other TimeMaps but actually also lists Mementos.\n\n   In both cases, including the \"from\" and \"until\" attributes for\n   \"timemap\" links is RECOMMENDED as a means to express the temporal\n   span of Mementos listed in each TimeMap.  Note that TimeMaps obtained\n   by following a \"timemap\" link can contain links to further TimeMaps.\n\n   <http://a.example.org>;rel=\"original\",\n    <http://arxiv.example.net/timegate/http://a.example.org>\n      ; rel=\"timegate\",\n    <http://arxiv.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org>\n      ; rel=\"self\";type=\"application/link-format\",\n    <http://arxiv1.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org>\n      ; rel=\"timemap\";type=\"application/link-format\"\n      ; from=\"Wed, 21 Jun 2000 04:41:56 GMT\"\n      ; until=\"Wed, 09 Apr 2008 20:30:51 GMT\",\n    <http://arxiv2.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org>\n      ; rel=\"timemap\";type=\"application/link-format\"\n      ; from=\"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 20:30:51 GMT\"\n      ; until=\"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 20:49:54 GMT\",\n    <http://arxiv3.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org>\n      ; rel=\"timemap\";type=\"application/link-format\"\n      ; from=\"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 20:30:51 GMT\"\n\n                         Figure 29: Index TimeMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

Mementos for TimeMaps\n\n   A TimeMap itself can act as an Original Resource for which a TimeGate\n   and Mementos may exist.  Hence, the response from a TimeMap could\n   include a \"timegate\" link to a TimeGate via which prior TimeMap\n   versions are available.  And, in cases where URI-T=URI-R=URI-G (a\n   TimeMap is an Original Resource that acts as its own TimeGate), an\n   \"original\" link pointing at the TimeMap URI-T would be included.\n\n   Therefore, caution is required in cases where a TimeMap for an\n   Original Resource wants to explicitly express in a \"Link\" header for\n   which Original Resource it is a TimeMap.  It can do so by including a\n   \"timemap\" link that has the URI-R of the Original Resource as Context\n   IRI and the URI-T of the TimeMap as Target IRI.\n\n   Figure 31 shows the response to an HTTP HEAD request against a\n   TimeMap that has\n   http://arxiv.example.net/timemap/http://a.example.org as URI-T.  This\n   TimeMap provides information about Mementos for the Original Resource\n   that has http://a.example.org as URI-R.  The response includes an\n   \"original\" link pointing to the Original Resource that this TimeMap\n   is about.  Note the use of the \"anchor\" attribute in this link to\n   convey the URI-R of that Original Resource.\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.

IANA Considerations\n\n6.1.  HTTP Headers\n\n   IANA has registered the \"Accept-Datetime\" and \"Memento-Datetime\" HTTP\n   headers (defined in Section 2.1.1) in the \"Permanent Message Header\n   Field Names\" registry:\n\n   o  Header field name: Accept-Datetime\n   o  Applicable protocol: \"http\" (RFC 2616)\n   o  Status: informational\n   o  Author/Change controller: Herbert Van de Sompel, Los Alamos\n      National Laboratory, hvdsomp@gmail.com\n   o  Specification document(s): this document\n\n   o  Header field name: Memento-Datetime\n   o  Applicable protocol: \"http\" (RFC 2616)\n   o  Status: informational\n   o  Author/Change controller: Herbert Van de Sompel, Los Alamos\n      National Laboratory, hvdsomp@gmail.com\n   o  Specification document(s): this document\n\n6.2.  Link Relation Types\n\n   IANA has registered the Relation Types \"original\", \"timegate\",\n   \"timemap\", and \"memento\" (defined in Section 2.2) in the \"Link\n   Relation Types\" registry:\n\n   o  Relation Name: original\n   o  Description: The Target IRI points to an Original Resource.\n   o  Reference: this document\n   o  Notes: An Original Resource is a resource that exists or used to\n      exist, and for which access to one of its prior states may be\n      required.\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.         Informational                    [Page 40]\n\nRFC 7089                      HTTP Memento                 December 2013\n\n\n   o  Relation Name: timegate\n   o  Description: The Target IRI points to a TimeGate for an Original\n      Resource.\n   o  Reference: this document\n   o  Notes: A TimeGate for an Original Resource is a resource that is\n      capable of datetime negotiation to support access to prior states\n      of the Original Resource.\n\n   o  Relation Name: timemap\n   o  Description: The Target IRI points to a TimeMap for an Original\n      Resource.\n   o  Reference: this document\n   o  Notes: A TimeMap for an Original Resource is a resource from which\n      a list of URIs of Mementos of the Original Resource is available.\n\n   o  Relation Name: memento\n   o  Description: The Target IRI points to a Memento, a fixed resource\n      that will not change state anymore.\n   o  Reference: this document\n   o  Notes: A Memento for an Original Resource is a resource that\n      encapsulates a prior state of the Original Resource.\n\n7.  Security Considerations\n\n   Provision of a \"timegate\" HTTP \"Link\" header in responses to requests\n   for an Original Resource that is protected (e.g., 401 or 403 HTTP\n   response codes) is OPTIONAL.  The inclusion of this Link when\n   requesting authentication is at the server's discretion; cases may\n   exist in which a server protects the current state of a resource, but\n   supports open access to prior states and thus chooses to supply this\n   HTTP \"Link\" header.  Conversely, the server may choose to not\n   advertise the TimeGate URIs (e.g., they exist in an intranet archive)\n   for unauthenticated requests.\n\n   The veracity of archives and the relationships between Original\n   Resources and Mementos is beyond the scope of this document.  Even in\n   the absence of malice, it is possible for separate archives to have\n   different Mementos for the same Original Resource at the same\n   datetime if the state of the Original Resource was dependent on the\n   requesting archive's user agent IP address, specific HTTP request\n   headers, and possibly other factors.\n\n   Further authentication, encryption, and other security-related issues\n   are otherwise orthogonal to Memento.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan de Sompel, et al.
