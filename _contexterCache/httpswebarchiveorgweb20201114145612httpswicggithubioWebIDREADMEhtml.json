align=right src=\"http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg\" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.\n<p>\nHistory is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.\n<p>\nThe main site for Archive Team is at <a href=\"http://www.archiveteam.org\">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.\n<p>\nThis collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href=\"http://archive.org/web/web.php\">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. \n<p>\nOur collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.\n<p>\n<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures. \n<p>\n\t</div>\n\t      </div>\n      <div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:49%;\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"c-logo\" style=\"background-image:url(https://archive.org/services/img/archiveteam_urls)\"></span>\n\t\t<div>Collection: <a style=\"color:#33f;\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_urls\" target=\"_new\"><span class=\"wm-title\">Archive Team: URLs</span></a></div>\n\t      </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"wm-capinfo-timestamps\">\n    <div style=\"background-color:#666;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\" title=\"Timestamps for the elements of this page\">TIMESTAMPS</div>\n    <div>\n      <div id=\"wm-capresources\" style=\"margin:0 5px 5px 5px;max-height:250px;overflow-y:scroll !important\"></div>\n      <div id=\"wm-capresources-loading\" style=\"text-align:left;margin:0 20px 5px 5px;display:none\"><img src=\"/_static/images/loading.gif\" alt=\"loading\" /></div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  </div></div></div></div><div id=\"wm-ipp-print\">The Wayback Machine - https://web.archive.org/web/20201114145612/https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n__wm.bt(675,27,25,2,\"web\",\"https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html\",\"20201114145612\",1996,\"/_static/\",[\"/_static/css/banner-styles.css?v=fantwOh2\",\"/_static/css/iconochive.css?v=qtvMKcIJ\"], false);\n  __wm.rw(1);\n</script>\n<!-- END WAYBACK TOOLBAR INSERT -->\n    <div class=\"header\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        <span class=\"title\"><a href=\"/web/20201114145612/https://wicg.github.io/WebID/\">WebID</a></span>\n        <span class=\"navigation\">\n          <span><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201114145612/https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID/issues/new\">feedback</a></span>\n        </span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <main>\n      <div class=\"doc\">\n\t<div class=\"post\">\n  \n    <h1 class=\"post-title\">WebID</h1>\n  \n  <div class=\"post-info\">\n    <!--\n    <div>\n      \n    </div>\n    -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"post-body\">\n    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>; This is an <strong>early exploration</strong> of ways that Browsers can help users of the Web make safer decisions [<a href=\"#the-rp-tracking-problem\">1</a>, <a href=\"#the-idp-tracking-problem\">2</a>] while logging-in on websites with identity providers with identity-specific APIs.</p>\n\n<p>This explainer is broken down into:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#the-problem\">The Problem Space</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/web/20201114145612/https://wicg.github.io/WebID/prior.html\">The Prior Art</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/web/20201114145612/https://wicg.github.io/WebID/privacy_threat_model.html\">The Threat Model</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/web/20201114145612/https://wicg.github.io/WebID/design.html\">The Solution Space</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem</h1>\n\n<p>Over the last decade, identity federation has unquestionably played a central role in raising the bar for authentication on the web, in terms of ease-of-use (e.g. passwordless single sign-on), security (e.g. improved resistance to phishing and credential stuffing attacks) and trustworthiness compared to its preceding pattern: per-site usernames and passwords.</p>\n\n<p>The standards that define how identity federation works today were built independently of the web platform, and their designers had to work <strong>around</strong> its limitations rather than extending them.

Federation is implemented via parameters on redirects / top level navigation, which allow for arbitrary data exchange, without insight or controls by the userâs browser.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe Classification Problem, the RP Tracking Problem and the IDP Tracking Problem are the problems that we are set to solve.\n\nThe following should give you a deeper understanding of the problems, related problems and how they were tackled in the past:\n\n\n  Prior Art\n  The Threat Model: a formalization of the problem\n  Related Problems\n\n\nWith a solid understanding of the problem space, you can read below some of the thoughts on how to address them:\n\n\n  An early exploration of The Solution Space\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    January 01, 2020 (created)\n    \n    \n    \n    October 07, 2020 (last update)\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n  ","length":5556,"excerpt":"TL;DR; This is an early exploration of ways that Browsers can help users of the Web make safer decisions [1, 2] while logging-in on websites with identity providers with identity-specific APIs.","byline":null,"dir":null,"siteName":null,"lang":"en"},"finalizedMeta":{"title":"\n    \n      WebID Â· WebID\n    \n  ","description":"TL;DR; This is an early exploration of ways that Browsers can help users of the Web make safer decisions [1, 2] while logging-in on websites with identity providers with identity-specific APIs.","author":false,"creator":"","publisher":false,"date":"2022-04-05T19:50:31.773Z","topics":[]},"jsonLd":{"@type":false,"headline":false,"description":false,"image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":false,"@id":false},"datePublished":false,"dateModified":false,"isAccessibleForFree":false,"isPartOf":{"@type":[],"name":false,"productID":false},"discussionUrl":false,"license":false,"author":{"@type":false,"name":false,"description":false,"sameAs":false,"image":{"@type":false,"url":false},"givenName":false,"familyName":false,"alternateName":false,"publishingPrinciples":false},"publisher":{"@type":false,"name":false,"description":false,"sameAs":false,"logo":{"@type":false,"url":false},"publishingPrinciples":false},"editor":{"@type":false,"name":false,"description":false,"sameAs":false,"image":{"@type":false,"url":false},"givenName":false,"familyName":false,"alternateName":false,"publishingPrinciples":false}},"twitterObj":false,"status":200,"metadata":{"author":false,"title":"\n    \n      WebID Â· WebID\n    \n  ","description":false,"canonical":"https://web.archive.org/web/20201114145612/https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html","keywords":[],"image":"/_static/images/toolbar/wayback-toolbar-logo-200.png","firstParagraph":"\nHistory is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there.
