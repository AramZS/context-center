<a\nhref=\"https://doc.searls.com/2024/10/25/personal-agentic-ai/\">Personal\nAgentic AI</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><q>Wouldn’t it be good for corporate AI agents to have customer hands\nto shake that are also equipped with agentic AI? Wouldn’t those\ncustomers be better than ones whose agency is merely human, and limited\nto only what corporate AI agents allow?</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The obvious answer for business decision-makers today is:\n<strong>lol, no, a locked-in customer is worth more.</strong> If, as a\nperson who likes to watch TV, you had an AI agent, then the agent could\nkeep track of sports seasons and the availability of movies and TV\nshows, and turn your streaming subscriptions on and off. In the\nstreaming business, like many others, the management consensus is to\nmake things as <a\nhref=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/cable-companies-ask-5th-circuit-to-block-ftcs-click-to-cancel-rule/\">hard\nand manual as possible on the customer side</a>, and save the automation\nfor the company side. <a\nhref=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/nfl-player-illegally-streams-his-own-teams-game-garners-mostly-sympathy/\">Just\nkeeping up with watching a National Football League team is hard…even\nfor someone who is ON the team</a>. Automation asymmetry, where the\nseller gets to reduce service costs while the customer has to do more\nand more manual work, is seen as a big win by the decision-makers on the\nhigh-automation side.</p>\n<p>Big company decision-makers don’t want to let smaller companies have\ntheir own <q>agentic</q> tools, either. Getting a <a\nhref=\"https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-ifixit-free-the-mcflurry-win-copyright-office-dmca-exemption-for-ice-cream-machines/\">DMCA\nExemption to let McDonald’s franchisees fix their ice cream machines</a>\nwas a <a\nhref=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/us-copyright-office-frees-the-mcflurry-allowing-repair-of-ice-cream-machines/\">big\ndeal that required a lengthy process with the US Copyright Office</a>.\nMany other small businesses are locked in to the manual, low-information\nside of a business relationship with a larger one. (Web advertising is\nanother example. Google shoots at everyone’s feet, and <a\nhref=\"https://digiday.com/media-buying/confessions-of-a-media-buyer-on-googles-stranglehold-on-the-industry/\">agencies</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/why-we-must-stop-google/\">smaller\nfirms</a>, and <a\nhref=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-cracking-down-on-ad-blockers\">browser\nextension developers</a> dance.)<span class=\"aside\">Google employees and\nshareholders would be better off if it were <a\nhref=\"https://blog.zgp.org/how-to-break-up-google/\">split into two\ncompanies</a> that could focus on useful projects for independent\ncustomers who had real choices.</span></p>\n<p>The first wave of user reactions to AI is happening, and it’s\nadversarial. Artists on sites like DeviantArt went first, and now <a\nhref=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/fake-restaurant-tips-on-reddit-a-reminder-of-google-ai-overviews-inherent-flaws/\">Reddit\nusers are deliberately posting fake answers to feed Google’s AI</a>. On\nthe shopping side, avoiding the output of AI and <a\nhref=\"https://larslofgren.com/parasite-seo/\">made-for-AI deceptive\ncrap</a> is becoming a must-have mainstream skill, as covered in <a\nhref=\"https://housefresh.com/finding-helpful-content-in-an-enshittified-google/\">How\nto find helpful content in a sea of made-for-Google BS</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/how-apple-and-microsofts-trusted-brands-are-being-used-to-scam-you.html\">How\nApple and Microsoft’s trusted brands are being used to scam you</a>. As\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-mainstreaming-of-ai-scepticism/\">Baldur\nBjarnason writes</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><q>The public has for a while now switched to using <q>AI</q> as a\nnegative—using the term <q>artificial</q> much as you do with\n<q>artificial flavouring</q> or <q>that smile’s artificial</q>. It’s\ninsincere creativity or deceptive intelligence.</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other news is even worse.

And it sounds like Doc is already thinking\npost-bubble.</p>\n<section id=\"adversarial-now-but-what-about-later\" class=\"level3\">\n<h3>Adversarial now, but what about later?</h3>\n<p>So how do we get from the AI adversarial situation we have now to the\nwin-win that Doc is looking for? Part of the answer will be resolving\nthe <a href=\"https://blog.zgp.org/ai-legal-links/\">legal issues</a>.\nToday’s Napster-like free-for-all environment won’t persist, so\neventually we will have an AI scene in which companies that want to use\nyour work for training have to get permission and <a\nhref=\"https://perkinscoie.com/insights/update/ab-2013-new-california-ai-law-mandates-disclosure-genai-training-data\">disclose\nprovenance</a>.</p>\n<p>The other part of the path from today’s situation—where big companies\nhave AI that enables <a\nhref=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/opinion/scams-trust-institutions.html\">scam\nculture</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://pluralistic.net/tag/chickenization/\">chickenization</a>\nwhile individuals and small companies are stuck rowing through <a\nhref=\"https://doc.searls.com/2015/12/05/at-last-cluetrains-time-has-come/\">funnels\nand pipelines</a>—is personal, aligned AI that balances automation\nasymmetries. Whether it’s solving CAPTCHAs, getting data in\nhard-to-parse formats, or other <a\nhref=\"https://blog.zgp.org/cpra-comments/\">awkward mazes</a>, automation\nasymmetries mean that as a customer, you technically have more\noptionality than you practically have time to use. But AI has a lot more\ntime. If a company gives you user experience grief, with the right tools\nyou can get back to where you would have been if they had applied less\nobfuscation in the first place. (icymi: <a\nhref=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/\">Video\nscraping: extracting JSON data from a 35 second screen capture for less\nthan 1/10th of a cent</a> Not a deliberate obfuscation example, but an\napproach that can be applied.)</p>\n<p>So we’re going to see something like <a\nhref=\"https://marketoonist.com/2023/03/ai-written-ai-read.html\">this AI\ncartoon by Tom Fishburne</a> (thanks to Doc for the link) for <a\nhref=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/#privacy-labour\">privacy\nlabour</a>. Companies are already getting expensive\nsoftware-as-a-service to make privacy tasks harder for the customers,\nwhich means that customers are going to get AI services to make it\neasier. Eventually some companies will notice the extra layers, <a\nhref=\"https://blog.zgp.org/30-40-30/\">pay attention to the research</a>,\nand get rid of the excess grief on their end so you can stop running\nde-obfuscation on your end. That will make it work better for everyone.\n(<a href=\"https://blog.zgp.org/gpc-all-the-things/\">GPC all the\nthings!</a> <a href=\"https://datarightsprotocol.org/\">Data Rights\nProtocol</a>)</p>\n<p>The biggest win from personal AI will, strangely enough, be in\n<em>de</em>-personalizing your personal information environment. By\ndoing the privacy labour for you, the <q>agentic</q> AI will limit your\n<q>addressability</q> and reduce <a\nhref=\"https://blog.zgp.org/personalization-risks/\">personalization\nrisks</a>. The risks to me from buying the less suitable of two legit\nbrands are much lower than the risk of getting stuck with some awful\ncrap that was personalized to me and not picked up on by <a\nhref=\"https://blog.zgp.org/when-can-deceptive-sellers-outbid-honest-sellers-for-ad-impressions/\">norms\nenforcers like Consumer Reports</a>. Getting more of my privacy labour\ndone for me will not just help me personally do better\n#mindfulConsumption, but also <a\nhref=\"https://blog.zgp.org/marketer-journey/\">increase the rewards for\nwin-win moves by sellers</a>. <span class=\"aside\">Personalization might\nbe nifty, but filtering out crap and rip-offs is a bigger immediate win:\n<a href=\"https://blog.zgp.org/internet-optimism/\">Sunday Internet\noptimism</a></span> Doc writes, <q>When you limit what customers can\nbring to markets, you limit what can happen in those markets.</q> As far\nas I can tell, the real promise for agentic AI isn’t just in enabling\nexisting processes or making them more efficient. It’s in establishing a\ncredible deterrent to enshittification—if you’re trying to rip me off,\ndon’t talk to me, talk to my bot army.</p>\n<p>For just a minute, put yourself in the shoes of a product manager\nwith a proposal for some legit project that they’re trying to get\napproved. If that proposal is up against a quick win for the company,\nlike one based on <a\nhref=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/\">creepy\nsurveillance</a>, it’s going to lose.

Companies are already getting expensive\nsoftware-as-a-service to make privacy tasks harder for the customers,\nwhich means that customers are going to get AI services to make it\neasier. Eventually some companies will notice the extra layers, pay attention to the research,\nand get rid of the excess grief on their end so you can stop running\nde-obfuscation on your end. That will make it work better for everyone.\n(GPC all the\nthings! Data Rights\nProtocol)\nThe biggest win from personal AI will, strangely enough, be in\nde-personalizing your personal information environment. By\ndoing the privacy labour for you, the agentic AI will limit your\naddressability and reduce personalization\nrisks. The risks to me from buying the less suitable of two legit\nbrands are much lower than the risk of getting stuck with some awful\ncrap that was personalized to me and not picked up on by norms\nenforcers like Consumer Reports. Getting more of my privacy labour\ndone for me will not just help me personally do better\n#mindfulConsumption, but also increase the rewards for\nwin-win moves by sellers. Personalization might\nbe nifty, but filtering out crap and rip-offs is a bigger immediate win:\nSunday Internet\noptimism Doc writes, When you limit what customers can\nbring to markets, you limit what can happen in those markets. As far\nas I can tell, the real promise for agentic AI isn’t just in enabling\nexisting processes or making them more efficient. It’s in establishing a\ncredible deterrent to enshittification—if you’re trying to rip me off,\ndon’t talk to me, talk to my bot army.\nFor just a minute, put yourself in the shoes of a product manager\nwith a proposal for some legit project that they’re trying to get\napproved. If that proposal is up against a quick win for the company,\nlike one based on creepy\nsurveillance, it’s going to lose. But if the customers have the\nautomation power to lower the ROI from creepy growth hacking, the legit\nproject has a chance. And that pushes up the long-term value of the\nentire company. An individual locked-in customer is more\nvaluable to the brand than an individual independent customer, but a\nbrand with independent customers is more valuable than a brand with an\nequal number of locked-in customers.\nAnyway, hope to see you at VRM Day.\n\n\nBonus links\nSpace is Dead.
