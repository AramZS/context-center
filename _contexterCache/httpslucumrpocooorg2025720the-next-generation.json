First, I had the\nopportunity to be part of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqBqdNIPrbo\">new Python\ndocumentary</a>, which brought back a\nflood of memories (good and bad).  Second, I&#8217;ve found myself accidentally\npulled towards agentic coding and vibe coders<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup>.  Over the last month and a half\nI have spoken with so many people on AI and programming and realized that a\ngrowing number of them are people I might not, in the past, have described as\n“programmers.”  Even on the way to the conference I had the pleasure to engage\nin a multi-hour discussion on the train with an air traffic controller who\nventured into programming because of ChatGPT to make his life easier.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure where I first heard it, but I like the idea that you are what you\ndo. If you&#8217;re painting (even your very first painting) you are a painter.\nConsequently if you create a program, by hand or with the aid of an agent, you\nare a programmer.  Many people become programmers essentially overnight by\npicking up one of these tools.</p>\n<p>Heading to EuroPython this year I worried that the community that shaped me\nmight not be receptive to AI and agentic programming.  Some of that fear felt\nwarranted: over the last year I saw a number of dismissive posts in my circles\nabout using AI for programming.  Yet I have also come to realize that acceptance\nof AI has shifted significantly.  More importantly there is pretty wide support\nof the notion that newcomers will and should be writing AI-generated code.</p>\n<p>That matters, because my view is that AI will not lead to <em>fewer</em> programmers.\nIn fact, the opposite seems likely.  AI will bring more people into programming\nthan anything else we have done in the last decade.</p>\n<p>For the Python community in particular, this is a moment to reflect.  Python has\ndemonstrated its inclusivity repeatedly — think of how many people have become\nsuccessful software engineers through outreach programs (like\n<a href=\"https://pyladies.com/\">PyLadies</a>) and community support.  I myself can credit\nmuch of my early carreer from learning from others on the Python IRC channels.</p>\n<p>We need to pay close attention to vibe coding.  And that not because it might\nproduce lower‑quality code, but because if we don&#8217;t intentionally welcome the\nnext generation learning through these tools, they will miss out on important\nlessons many of us learned the hard way.  It would be a mistake to treat them\nas outcasts or “not real” programmers.  Remember that many of our first\nprograms did not have functions, were a mess of GOTO and things copy/pasted\ntogether.</p>\n<p>Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to make\nChatGPT build something.  Lucky for us: in many of those cases the AI picks\nPython.  We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate an expansion in\nthe kinds of people who might want to attend a Python conference.  Yet many of\nthese new programmers are not even aware that programming communities and\nconferences exist.  It’s in the Python community’s interest to find ways to\npull them in.</p>\n<p>Consider this: I can name the person who brought me into Python.  But if you\nwere brought in via ChatGPT or a programming agent, there may be no human there\n— just the AI.  That lack of human connection is, I think, the biggest\ndownside.  So we will need to compensate: to reach out, to mentor, to create\non‑ramps.  To instil the idea that you should be looking for a community,\nbecause the AI won&#8217;t do that.  We need to turn a solitary interaction with an\nAI into a shared journey with a community, and to move them towards learning\nthe important lessons about engineering.  We do not want to have a generation\nof developers held captive by a companies building vibe-coding tools with\nlittle incentive for their users to break from those shackles.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding\">vibe coders</a> here\nas people that give in to having the machine program for them.

A decade ago I wrote about how much I owed the\nPython community.  Recently I found\nmyself reminiscing again. This year at EuroPython I even gave a brief lightning\ntalk recalling my time in the community — it made me tear up a little.\nThere were two reasons for this trip down memory lane.  First, I had the\nopportunity to be part of the new Python\ndocumentary, which brought back a\nflood of memories (good and bad).  Second, I’ve found myself accidentally\npulled towards agentic coding and vibe coders1.
