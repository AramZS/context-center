Even \"garbage in, garbage out\" is an articulation of this principle — a system should be predictable enough in its operation that we can then rely on it when building other systems upon it.\nThis core concept of a system being reason-able is pervasive in the intellectual architecture of true technologies. Postel's Law (\"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.\") depends on reasonable-ness. The famous IETF keywords list, which offers a specific technical definition for terms like \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\", assumes that a system will behave in a reasonable and predictable way, and the entire internet runs on specifications that sit on top of that assumption.\nThe very act of debugging assumes that a system is meant to work in a particular way, with repeatable outputs, and that deviations from those expectations are the manifestation of that bug, which is why being able to reproduce a bug is the very first step to debugging.\nInto that world, let's introduce bullshit. Today's highly-hyped generative AI systems (most famously OpenAI) are designed to generate bullshit by design. To be clear, bullshit can sometimes be useful, and even accidentally correct, but that doesn't keep it from being bullshit. Worse, these systems are not meant to generate consistent bullshit — you can get different bullshit answers from the same prompts. You can put garbage in and get... bullshit out, but the same quality bullshit that you get from non-garbage inputs! And enthusiasts are current mistaking the fact that the bullshit is consistently wrapped in the same envelope as meaning that the bullshit inside is consistent, laundering the unreasonable-ness into appearing reasonable.\nNow we have billions of dollars being invested into technologies where it is impossible to make falsifiable assertions. A system that you cannot debug through a logical, socratic process is a vulnerability that exploitative tech tycoons will use to do what they always do, undermine the vulnerable.\nSo, what can we do? A simple thing for technologists, or those who work with them, to do is to make a simple demand: we need systems we can reason about. A system where we can provide the same input multiple times, and the response will change in minor or major ways, for unknown and unknowable reasons, and yet we're expected to rebuild entire other industries or ecosystems around it, is merely a tool for manipulation.\nNarcissists and abusers use the inconsistent and capricious changing of responses as a way of controlling and manipulating their victims. They are unreasonable because it is an effective way to keep the vulnerable in a place where they constantly have to respond, or where they have to live in a constant state of fear and anticipation about how they will be expected to react. Technologies are created by people, and systems reflect the values of their creators.\nWe should react to unreasonableness in purported technologies in the same way we react to intentional unreasonableness in people in positions of power: set firm boundaries, be ready to walk away, don't debate, demand consistent and reasonable behavior.\n\n  ","length":4190,"excerpt":"A blog about making culture.
