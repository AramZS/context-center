class=\"field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden\"><div class=\"field__items\"><div class=\"field__item even\"><p><span>As age verification bills pass across the world under the guise of “keeping children safe online,” governments are increasingly giving themselves the authority to decide what topics are deemed “safe” for young people to access, and forcing online services to remove and block anything that may be deemed “unsafe.” </span><span>This growing legislative trend has sparked significant concerns and numerous First Amendment challenges, including a case currently pending before the Supreme Court–</span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/five-things-know-about-supreme-court-case-texas-age-verification-law-free-speech\"><span>Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton.</span></a><span> The Court is now considering how government-mandated age verification impacts adults’ free speech rights online.</span></p>\n<p><span>These challenges keep arising because this isn’t just about safety—it’s censorship. Age verification laws target a slew of broadly-defined topics. Some block access to websites that contain some \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" but define the term so loosely that “sexual material” could encompass anything from sex education to R-rated movies; others simply list a variety of vaguely-defined harms. In either instance, lawmakers and regulators could use the laws to target LGBTQ+ content online.</span></p>\n<p><span>This risk is especially clear given what we already know about platform content policies. These policies, which claim to \"protect children\" or keep sites “family-friendly,” often </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/blunt-policies-and-secretive-enforcement-mechanisms-lgbtq-and-sexual-health\"><span>label LGBTQ+ content </span></a><span>as “adult” or “harmful,” while similar content that doesn't involve the LGBTQ+ community is left untouched. Sometimes, this impact—the censorship of LGBTQ+ content—is implicit, and only becomes clear when the policies (and/or laws) are actually implemented. Other times, this intended impact is explicitly spelled out in the text of the policies and bills. <br /></span></p>\n<p><span>In either case, it is critical to recognize that age verification bills could block far more than just pornography. </span></p>\n<p><span>Take Oklahoma’s bill, </span><a href=\"http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB1959&amp;Session=2400\"><span>SB 1959</span></a><span>, for example. This state age verification law aims to prevent young people from accessing content that is “harmful to minors” and went into effect last November 1st. It incorporates definitions from another Oklahoma statute, </span><a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/title-21/section-21-1040-75/\"><span>Statute 21-1040</span></a><span>, which defines material “harmful to minors” as any description or exhibition, in whatever form, of nudity and “sexual conduct.” That same statute then defines “sexual conduct” as including acts of “homosexuality.” Explicitly, then, SB 1959 requires a site to verify someone’s age before showing them content about homosexuality—a vague enough term that it could potentially apply to content from organizations like <a href=\"http://www.glaad.org\">GLAAD</a> and <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/lgbtq\">Planned Parenthood</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>This vague definition will undoubtedly cause platforms to over-censor content relating to LGBTQ+ life, health, or rights out of fear of liability. Separately, bills such as SB 1959 might also cause users to self-police their own speech for the same reasons, fearing de-platforming. The law leaves platforms unsure and unable to precisely exclude the minimum amount of content that fits the bill's definition, leading them to over censorship of content that may just also include this very blog post. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Beyond Individual States: Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></h3>\n<p><span>Laws like the proposed federal </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/kids-online-safety-act-continues-threaten-our-rights-online-year-review-2024\"><span>Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></a><span> make government officials the arbiters of what young people can see online and will lead platforms to implement invasive age verification measures to avoid the threat of liability. If KOSA passes, it will lead to people who make online content about sex education, and LGBTQ+ identity and health, being </span><a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/kosa-senator-blackburn-censor-trans-content\"><span>persecuted and shut down as well</span></a><span>. All it will take is one member of the Federal Trade Commission seeking to score political points, or a state attorney general seeking to ensure re-election, to start going after the online speech they don’t like. These speech burdens will also affect regular users as platforms mass-delete content in the name of avoiding lawsuits and investigations under KOSA. </span></p>\n<p><span>Senator Marsha Blackburn, co-sponsor of KOSA, has </span><a href=\"https://x.com/family_policy/status/1697693651999264869\"><span>expressed a priority</span></a><span> in “protecting minor children from the transgender [sic] in this culture and that influence.” KOSA, to Senator Blackburn, would address this problem by limiting content in the places “where children are being indoctrinated.” Yet these efforts all fail to protect children from the </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech\"><span>actual harms of the online world</span></a><span>, and instead deny vulnerable young people a crucial avenue of communication and access to information. </span></p>\n<h3><span>LGBTQ+ Platform Censorship by Design</span></h3>\n<p><span>While the censorship of LGBTQ+ content through age verification laws can be represented as an </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/will-kosa-coppa-20-controversial-bills-explained-rcna163243\"><span>“unintended consequence”</span></a><span> in certain instances, barring access to LGBTQ+ content is part of the platforms' design. One of the more pervasive examples is Meta </span><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/instagram-blocked-teens-from-searching\"><span>suppressing LGBTQ+ content</span></a><span> across its platforms under the guise of protecting younger users from \"sexually suggestive content.” According to </span><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/instagram-blocked-teens-from-searching\"><span>a recent report</span></a><span>, Meta has been hiding posts that reference LGBTQ+ hashtags like #lesbian, #bisexual, #gay, #trans, and #queer for users that turned the sensitive content filter on, as well as showing users a blank page when they attempt to search for LGBTQ+ terms. This leaves teenage users with no choice in what content they see, since the sensitive content filter is turned on for them by default. </span></p>\n<p><span>This policy change came on the back of a protracted effort by Meta to allegedly protect teens online. In January last year, the corporation announced a </span><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/01/teen-protections-age-appropriate-experiences-on-our-apps/\"><span>new set of “sensitive content” restrictions</span></a><span> across its platforms (Instagram, Facebook, and Threads), including hiding content which the platform no longer considered age-appropriate. This was followed later by the introduction of </span><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/\"><span>Instagram For Teens</span></a><span> to further limit the content users under the age of 18 could see. This feature sets minors’ accounts to the most restrictive levels by default, and teens under 16 can only reverse those settings through a parent or guardian. </span></p>\n<p><span>Meta has </span><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/instagram-blocked-teens-from-searching\"><span>apparently</span></a><span> now reversed the restrictions on LGBTQ+ content after calling the issue a “mistake.” This is not good enough. In allowing pro-LGBTQ+ content to be integrated into the sensitive content filter, Meta has aligned itself with those that are actively facilitating a violent and harmful removal of rights for LGBTQ+ people—all under the guise of keeping children and teens safe. Not only is this a deeply flawed strategy, it harms everyone who wishes to express themselves on the internet. These policies are written and enforced discriminatorily and at the expense of transgender, gender-fluid, and nonbinary speakers. They also often convince or require platforms to implement tools that, using the laws' vague and subjective definitions, end up blocking access to </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/how-lgbtq-content-censored-under-guise-sexually-explicit\"><span>LGBTQ+</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/reproductive-rights\"><span>reproductive health content</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>The censorship of this content prevents individuals from being able to engage with such material online to </span><a href=\"https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2018/12/04/queer-women-used-tumblr-explore-sexuality-now-its-over?\"><span>explore their identities</span></a><span>, advocate for broader societal acceptance and against hate, </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/self-proclaimed-free-speech-platforms-are-censoring-nude-content-heres-why-you\"><span>build communities</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/05/tossed-out-highlighting-effects-content-rules-online\"><span>discover new interests</span></a><span>. With corporations like Meta intervening to decide how people create, speak, and connect, a crucial form of engagement for all kinds of users has been removed and the voices of people with less power are regularly shut down. </span></p>\n<p><span>And at a time when LGBTQ+ individuals are already under vast pressure from violent </span><a href=\"https://glaad.org/releases/glaads-alert-desk-releases-new-data-on-rising-anti-lgbtq-hate-and-extremism/\"><span>homophobic threats offline</span></a><span>, these online restrictions have an amplified impact. </span></p>\n<p><span>LGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk of experiencing bullying and rejection, often turning to online spaces as outlets for self-expression. For those without family support or who face the threat of physical or emotional abuse at home because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, the internet becomes an essential resource. A </span><a href=\"https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/Out_Online_Full_Report_2013.pdf\"><span>report</span></a><span> from the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN) highlights that LGBTQ+ youth engage with the internet at higher rates than their peers, often showing greater levels of civic engagement online compared to offline. Access to digital communities and resources is critical for LGBTQ+ youth, and restricting access to them poses unique dangers.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Call to Action: Digital Rights Are LGBTQ+ Rights</span></h3>\n<p><span>These laws have the potential to harm us all—including the children they are designed to protect. </span></p>\n<p><span>As more U.S. states and countries pass age verification laws, it is crucial to recognize the broader implications these measures have on privacy, free speech, and access to information. This conglomeration of laws poses significant challenges for users trying to maintain anonymity online and access critical content—whether it’s LGBTQ+ resources, reproductive health information, or otherwise.

Measures Goes Beyond Porn Sites","content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p><span>As age verification bills pass across the world under the guise of “keeping children safe online,” governments are increasingly giving themselves the authority to decide what topics are deemed “safe” for young people to access, and forcing online services to remove and block anything that may be deemed “unsafe.” </span><span>This growing legislative trend has sparked significant concerns and numerous First Amendment challenges, including a case currently pending before the Supreme Court–</span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/five-things-know-about-supreme-court-case-texas-age-verification-law-free-speech\"><span>Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton.</span></a><span> The Court is now considering how government-mandated age verification impacts adults’ free speech rights online.</span></p>\n<p><span>These challenges keep arising because this isn’t just about safety—it’s censorship. Age verification laws target a slew of broadly-defined topics. Some block access to websites that contain some \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" but define the term so loosely that “sexual material” could encompass anything from sex education to R-rated movies; others simply list a variety of vaguely-defined harms. In either instance, lawmakers and regulators could use the laws to target LGBTQ+ content online.</span></p>\n<p><span>This risk is especially clear given what we already know about platform content policies. These policies, which claim to \"protect children\" or keep sites “family-friendly,” often </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/blunt-policies-and-secretive-enforcement-mechanisms-lgbtq-and-sexual-health\"><span>label LGBTQ+ content </span></a><span>as “adult” or “harmful,” while similar content that doesn't involve the LGBTQ+ community is left untouched. Sometimes, this impact—the censorship of LGBTQ+ content—is implicit, and only becomes clear when the policies (and/or laws) are actually implemented. Other times, this intended impact is explicitly spelled out in the text of the policies and bills. <br></span></p>\n<p><span>In either case, it is critical to recognize that age verification bills could block far more than just pornography. </span></p>\n<p><span>Take Oklahoma’s bill, </span><a href=\"http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB1959&amp;Session=2400\"><span>SB 1959</span></a><span>, for example. This state age verification law aims to prevent young people from accessing content that is “harmful to minors” and went into effect last November 1st. It incorporates definitions from another Oklahoma statute, </span><a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/title-21/section-21-1040-75/\"><span>Statute 21-1040</span></a><span>, which defines material “harmful to minors” as any description or exhibition, in whatever form, of nudity and “sexual conduct.” That same statute then defines “sexual conduct” as including acts of “homosexuality.” Explicitly, then, SB 1959 requires a site to verify someone’s age before showing them content about homosexuality—a vague enough term that it could potentially apply to content from organizations like <a href=\"http://www.glaad.org/\">GLAAD</a> and <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/lgbtq\">Planned Parenthood</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>This vague definition will undoubtedly cause platforms to over-censor content relating to LGBTQ+ life, health, or rights out of fear of liability. Separately, bills such as SB 1959 might also cause users to self-police their own speech for the same reasons, fearing de-platforming. The law leaves platforms unsure and unable to precisely exclude the minimum amount of content that fits the bill's definition, leading them to over censorship of content that may just also include this very blog post.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Beyond Individual States: Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></h3>\n<p><span>Laws like the proposed federal </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/kids-online-safety-act-continues-threaten-our-rights-online-year-review-2024\"><span>Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></a><span> make government officials the arbiters of what young people can see online and will lead platforms to implement invasive age verification measures to avoid the threat of liability. If KOSA passes, it will lead to people who make online content about sex education, and LGBTQ+ identity and health, being </span><a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/kosa-senator-blackburn-censor-trans-content\"><span>persecuted and shut down as well</span></a><span>. All it will take is one member of the Federal Trade Commission seeking to score political points, or a state attorney general seeking to ensure re-election, to start going after the online speech they don’t like. These speech burdens will also affect regular users as platforms mass-delete content in the name of avoiding lawsuits and investigations under KOSA.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Senator Marsha Blackburn, co-sponsor of KOSA, has </span><a href=\"https://x.com/family_policy/status/1697693651999264869\"><span>expressed a priority</span></a><span> in “protecting minor children from the transgender [sic] in this culture and that influence.” KOSA, to Senator Blackburn, would address this problem by limiting content in the places “where children are being indoctrinated.” Yet these efforts all fail to protect children from the </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech\"><span>actual harms of the online world</span></a><span>, and instead deny vulnerable young people a crucial avenue of communication and access to information.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>LGBTQ+ Platform Censorship by Design</span></h3>\n<p><span>While the censorship of LGBTQ+ content through age verification laws can be represented as an </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/will-kosa-coppa-20-controversial-bills-explained-rcna163243\"><span>“unintended consequence”</span></a><span> in certain instances, barring access to LGBTQ+ content is part of the platforms' design. One of the more pervasive examples is Meta </span><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/instagram-blocked-teens-from-searching\"><span>suppressing LGBTQ+ content</span></a><span> across its platforms under the guise of protecting younger users from \"sexually suggestive content.” According to </span><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/instagram-blocked-teens-from-searching\"><span>a recent report</span></a><span>, Meta has been hiding posts that reference LGBTQ+ hashtags like #lesbian, #bisexual, #gay, #trans, and #queer for users that turned the sensitive content filter on, as well as showing users a blank page when they attempt to search for LGBTQ+ terms. This leaves teenage users with no choice in what content they see, since the sensitive content filter is turned on for them by default.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>This policy change came on the back of a protracted effort by Meta to allegedly protect teens online. In January last year, the corporation announced a </span><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/01/teen-protections-age-appropriate-experiences-on-our-apps/\"><span>new set of “sensitive content” restrictions</span></a><span> across its platforms (Instagram, Facebook, and Threads), including hiding content which the platform no longer considered age-appropriate. This was followed later by the introduction of </span><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/\"><span>Instagram For Teens</span></a><span> to further limit the content users under the age of 18 could see. This feature sets minors’ accounts to the most restrictive levels by default, and teens under 16 can only reverse those settings through a parent or guardian.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Meta has </span><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/instagram-blocked-teens-from-searching\"><span>apparently</span></a><span> now reversed the restrictions on LGBTQ+ content after calling the issue a “mistake.” This is not good enough. In allowing pro-LGBTQ+ content to be integrated into the sensitive content filter, Meta has aligned itself with those that are actively facilitating a violent and harmful removal of rights for LGBTQ+ people—all under the guise of keeping children and teens safe. Not only is this a deeply flawed strategy, it harms everyone who wishes to express themselves on the internet. These policies are written and enforced discriminatorily and at the expense of transgender, gender-fluid, and nonbinary speakers. They also often convince or require platforms to implement tools that, using the laws' vague and subjective definitions, end up blocking access to </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/how-lgbtq-content-censored-under-guise-sexually-explicit\"><span>LGBTQ+</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/reproductive-rights\"><span>reproductive health content</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The censorship of this content prevents individuals from being able to engage with such material online to </span><a href=\"https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2018/12/04/queer-women-used-tumblr-explore-sexuality-now-its-over?\"><span>explore their identities</span></a><span>, advocate for broader societal acceptance and against hate, </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/self-proclaimed-free-speech-platforms-are-censoring-nude-content-heres-why-you\"><span>build communities</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/05/tossed-out-highlighting-effects-content-rules-online\"><span>discover new interests</span></a><span>. With corporations like Meta intervening to decide how people create, speak, and connect, a crucial form of engagement for all kinds of users has been removed and the voices of people with less power are regularly shut down.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>And at a time when LGBTQ+ individuals are already under vast pressure from violent </span><a href=\"https://glaad.org/releases/glaads-alert-desk-releases-new-data-on-rising-anti-lgbtq-hate-and-extremism/\"><span>homophobic threats offline</span></a><span>, these online restrictions have an amplified impact.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>LGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk of experiencing bullying and rejection, often turning to online spaces as outlets for self-expression. For those without family support or who face the threat of physical or emotional abuse at home because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, the internet becomes an essential resource. A </span><a href=\"https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/Out_Online_Full_Report_2013.pdf\"><span>report</span></a><span> from the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN) highlights that LGBTQ+ youth engage with the internet at higher rates than their peers, often showing greater levels of civic engagement online compared to offline. Access to digital communities and resources is critical for LGBTQ+ youth, and restricting access to them poses unique dangers.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Call to Action: Digital Rights Are LGBTQ+ Rights</span></h3>\n<p><span>These laws have the potential to harm us all—including the children they are designed to protect.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>As more U.S. states and countries pass age verification laws, it is crucial to recognize the broader implications these measures have on privacy, free speech, and access to information. This conglomeration of laws poses significant challenges for users trying to maintain anonymity online and access critical content—whether it’s LGBTQ+ resources, reproductive health information, or otherwise.

Paxton. The Court is now considering how government-mandated age verification impacts adults’ free speech rights online.\nThese challenges keep arising because this isn’t just about safety—it’s censorship. Age verification laws target a slew of broadly-defined topics. Some block access to websites that contain some \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" but define the term so loosely that “sexual material” could encompass anything from sex education to R-rated movies; others simply list a variety of vaguely-defined harms. In either instance, lawmakers and regulators could use the laws to target LGBTQ+ content online.\nThis risk is especially clear given what we already know about platform content policies. These policies, which claim to \"protect children\" or keep sites “family-friendly,” often label LGBTQ+ content as “adult” or “harmful,” while similar content that doesn't involve the LGBTQ+ community is left untouched. Sometimes, this impact—the censorship of LGBTQ+ content—is implicit, and only becomes clear when the policies (and/or laws) are actually implemented. Other times, this intended impact is explicitly spelled out in the text of the policies and bills. \nIn either case, it is critical to recognize that age verification bills could block far more than just pornography. \nTake Oklahoma’s bill, SB 1959, for example. This state age verification law aims to prevent young people from accessing content that is “harmful to minors” and went into effect last November 1st. It incorporates definitions from another Oklahoma statute, Statute 21-1040, which defines material “harmful to minors” as any description or exhibition, in whatever form, of nudity and “sexual conduct.” That same statute then defines “sexual conduct” as including acts of “homosexuality.” Explicitly, then, SB 1959 requires a site to verify someone’s age before showing them content about homosexuality—a vague enough term that it could potentially apply to content from organizations like GLAAD and Planned Parenthood.\nThis vague definition will undoubtedly cause platforms to over-censor content relating to LGBTQ+ life, health, or rights out of fear of liability. Separately, bills such as SB 1959 might also cause users to self-police their own speech for the same reasons, fearing de-platforming. The law leaves platforms unsure and unable to precisely exclude the minimum amount of content that fits the bill's definition, leading them to over censorship of content that may just also include this very blog post. \nBeyond Individual States: Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)\nLaws like the proposed federal Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) make government officials the arbiters of what young people can see online and will lead platforms to implement invasive age verification measures to avoid the threat of liability. If KOSA passes, it will lead to people who make online content about sex education, and LGBTQ+ identity and health, being persecuted and shut down as well. All it will take is one member of the Federal Trade Commission seeking to score political points, or a state attorney general seeking to ensure re-election, to start going after the online speech they don’t like. These speech burdens will also affect regular users as platforms mass-delete content in the name of avoiding lawsuits and investigations under KOSA. \nSenator Marsha Blackburn, co-sponsor of KOSA, has expressed a priority in “protecting minor children from the transgender [sic] in this culture and that influence.” KOSA, to Senator Blackburn, would address this problem by limiting content in the places “where children are being indoctrinated.” Yet these efforts all fail to protect children from the actual harms of the online world, and instead deny vulnerable young people a crucial avenue of communication and access to information. \nLGBTQ+ Platform Censorship by Design\nWhile the censorship of LGBTQ+ content through age verification laws can be represented as an “unintended consequence” in certain instances, barring access to LGBTQ+ content is part of the platforms' design. One of the more pervasive examples is Meta suppressing LGBTQ+ content across its platforms under the guise of protecting younger users from \"sexually suggestive content.” According to a recent report, Meta has been hiding posts that reference LGBTQ+ hashtags like #lesbian, #bisexual, #gay, #trans, and #queer for users that turned the sensitive content filter on, as well as showing users a blank page when they attempt to search for LGBTQ+ terms. This leaves teenage users with no choice in what content they see, since the sensitive content filter is turned on for them by default. \nThis policy change came on the back of a protracted effort by Meta to allegedly protect teens online. In January last year, the corporation announced a new set of “sensitive content” restrictions across its platforms (Instagram, Facebook, and Threads), including hiding content which the platform no longer considered age-appropriate. This was followed later by the introduction of Instagram For Teens to further limit the content users under the age of 18 could see. This feature sets minors’ accounts to the most restrictive levels by default, and teens under 16 can only reverse those settings through a parent or guardian. \nMeta has apparently now reversed the restrictions on LGBTQ+ content after calling the issue a “mistake.” This is not good enough. In allowing pro-LGBTQ+ content to be integrated into the sensitive content filter, Meta has aligned itself with those that are actively facilitating a violent and harmful removal of rights for LGBTQ+ people—all under the guise of keeping children and teens safe. Not only is this a deeply flawed strategy, it harms everyone who wishes to express themselves on the internet. These policies are written and enforced discriminatorily and at the expense of transgender, gender-fluid, and nonbinary speakers. They also often convince or require platforms to implement tools that, using the laws' vague and subjective definitions, end up blocking access to LGBTQ+ and reproductive health content. \nThe censorship of this content prevents individuals from being able to engage with such material online to explore their identities, advocate for broader societal acceptance and against hate, build communities, and discover new interests. With corporations like Meta intervening to decide how people create, speak, and connect, a crucial form of engagement for all kinds of users has been removed and the voices of people with less power are regularly shut down. \nAnd at a time when LGBTQ+ individuals are already under vast pressure from violent homophobic threats offline, these online restrictions have an amplified impact. \nLGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk of experiencing bullying and rejection, often turning to online spaces as outlets for self-expression. For those without family support or who face the threat of physical or emotional abuse at home because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, the internet becomes an essential resource. A report from the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) highlights that LGBTQ+ youth engage with the internet at higher rates than their peers, often showing greater levels of civic engagement online compared to offline. Access to digital communities and resources is critical for LGBTQ+ youth, and restricting access to them poses unique dangers.\nCall to Action: Digital Rights Are LGBTQ+ Rights\nThese laws have the potential to harm us all—including the children they are designed to protect. \nAs more U.S. states and countries pass age verification laws, it is crucial to recognize the broader implications these measures have on privacy, free speech, and access to information. This conglomeration of laws poses significant challenges for users trying to maintain anonymity online and access critical content—whether it’s LGBTQ+ resources, reproductive health information, or otherwise. These policies threaten the very freedoms they purport to protect, stifling conversations about identity, health, and social justice, and creating an environment of fear and repression. \nThe fight against these laws is not just about defending online spaces; it’s about safeguarding the fundamental rights of all individuals to express themselves and access life-saving information.\nWe need to stand up against these age verification laws—not only to protect users’ free expression rights, but also to safeguard the free flow of information that is vital to a democratic society. Reach out to your state and federal legislators, raise awareness about the consequences of these policies, and support organizations like the LGBT Tech, ACLU, the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, and others that are fighting for digital rights of young people alongside EFF.\nThe fight for the safety and rights of LGBTQ+ youth is not just a fight for visibility—it’s a fight for their very survival. Now more than ever, it’s essential for allies, advocates, and marginalized communities to push back against these dangerous laws and ensure that the internet remains a space where all voices can be heard, free from discrimination and censorship. \n\n","length":9692,"excerpt":"As age verification bills pass across the world under the guise of “keeping children safe online,” governments are increasingly giving themselves the authority to decide what topics are deemed “safe” for young people to access, and forcing online services to remove and block anything that may be...","byline":"Paige Collings and Rindala Alajaji","dir":"ltr","siteName":"Electronic Frontier Foundation","lang":"en"},"finalizedMeta":{"title":"The Impact of Age Verification Measures Goes Beyond Porn Sites","description":"As age verification bills pass across the world under the guise of “keeping children safe online,” governments are increasingly giving themselves the authority to decide what topics are deemed “safe” for young people to access, and forcing online services to remove and block anything that may be...","author":false,"creator":"Paige Collings and Rindala Alajaji","publisher":false,"date":"2025-01-30T11:43:15-08:00","topics":[]},"jsonLd":{"@type":false,"headline":false,"description":false,"image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":false,"@id":false},"datePublished":false,"dateModified":false,"isAccessibleForFree":false,"isPartOf":{"@type":[],"name":false,"productID":false},"discussionUrl":false,"license":false,"author":{"@type":false,"name":false,"description":false,"sameAs":false,"image":{"@type":false,"url":false},"givenName":false,"familyName":false,"alternateName":false,"publishingPrinciples":false},"publisher":{"@type":false,"name":false,"description":false,"sameAs":false,"logo":{"@type":false,"url":false},"publishingPrinciples":false},"editor":{"@type":false,"name":false,"description":false,"sameAs":false,"image":{"@type":false,"url":false},"givenName":false,"familyName":false,"alternateName":false,"publishingPrinciples":false}},"twitterObj":false,"status":200,"metadata":{"author":"Paige Collings and Rindala Alajaji","title":"The Impact of Age Verification Measures Goes Beyond Porn Sites | Electronic Frontier Foundation","description":"As age verification bills pass across the world under the guise of “keeping children safe online,” governments are increasingly giving themselves the authority to decide what topics are deemed “safe” for young people to access, and forcing online services to remove and block anything that may be...","canonical":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/impact-age-verification-measures-goes-beyond-porn-sites","keywords":[],"image":"https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/rainbow-1_0_0.png","firstParagraph":"As age verification bills pass across the world under the guise of “keeping children safe online,” governments are increasingly giving themselves the authority to decide what topics are deemed “safe” for young people to access, and forcing online services to remove and block anything that may be deemed “unsafe.” This growing legislative trend has sparked significant concerns and numerous First Amendment challenges, including a case currently pending before the Supreme Court–Free Speech Coalition v.
