communication and knowledge-sharing for everyone.\nIn order for the web to continue to be beneficial to society,\nwe need to include ethical thinking when we build\nweb technologies, applications, and sites.\nThe web is made up of a number of technologies and technical standards.\nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are often thought of as the web's core set of technologies\nbut there are a raft of other technologies, standards,\nlanguages and APIs that come together to form the \"web platform.\"\n\nIn the 30 years since development of the web began,\nit has become clear that the web platform can often be used in ways that subvert its original mission,\nor even be used to cause harm.\nThe web should be a platform that helps people\nand provides a net positive social benefit.\nAs we continue to evolve the web platform,\nwe must therefore consider the ethical implications of our work.\nThe web must be for good.\n\nOne of the web platform's differentiators has always been a strong ethical framework;\nfor example an emphasis on\n[internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/),\n[accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/),\n[privacy](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/), and\n[security](https://www.w3.org/Security/).\nWeb technologies are also offered\n[royalty free](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/)\nto enable open source implementation.\nThese are often cited as some of the strengths of the web.\n\nThe architecture of the web is designed with\nthe important notion of different classes of application that retrieve and process content,\nand represent the needs of the application's users.\nThis includes web browsers,\nweb-hosted applications such as search engines,\nand software that acts on web resources.\nThis lends itself well towards empowering people\nby allowing them to choose the browser, search engine, or other application\nthat best meets their needs\n(for example, with strong privacy protections).\n\nThe web should also support human rights, dignity and personal agency.\nWe need to put internationally recognized human rights at the core of the web platform [[?UDHR]].\nAnd we need to promote ethical thinking across the web industry\nto reinforce this approach.\n\nThe principles in this document are deliberately unordered,\nand many are interconnected with each other.\nWhile all of the principles together aim to provide pillars that collectively support\na web that is beneficial for society, there are cases where upholding one principle\nmay diminish the efficacy of another principle.\nThus in applying these principles, there are benefits and tradeoffs\nthat may need to be carefully balanced. When faced with principles\nwhich appear to be in conflict with one another,\nit is important to consider the context in which a particular technology\nis being applied, the expected audience(s) for the technology,\nwho the technology benefits and who it may disadvantage,\nand any power dynamics involved (see also the\n<a data-cite=\"design-principles#priority-of-constituencies\">priority of constituencies</a>).\n\nThe purpose of this document is\nto inform TAG review of new specifications\nand candidate additions to published recommendations,\nand to inform other documents such as the\n[[[Design-Principles]]], [[[security-privacy-questionnaire]]]\nor other similar checklists and sets of principles used by specification authors and editors.\nIt also serves to raise awareness of the ethical responsibilities of web makers.\n\n\n## Principles\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"oneweb\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThere is one web\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWhen we are adding new web technologies and platforms,\nwe will build them to cross regional and national boundaries.\nPeople in one location should be able to view web pages\nfrom anywhere that is connected to the web.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"noharm\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web should not cause harm to society\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWhen we are adding a feature or technology to the web,\nwe will consider what harm it could do to society or groups,\nespecially to vulnerable people.\nWe will prioritize potential benefits for web users over potential benefits to web developers,\ncontent providers, user agents, advertisers or others in the ecosystem,\nin line with the\n<a data-cite=\"design-principles#priority-of-constituencies\">priority of constituencies</a>.\nWe will ensure the requirements and views of marginalized communities\nand underrepresented groups are heard and respected.\nWe will build new web technologies in a collaborative manner\naccording to open processes\n(for example, the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/\">W3C process</a>),\nand adhering to codes of conduct\n(such as the W3C <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/\">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>).\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"community\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web must support healthy community and debate\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWe are building technologies and platforms for distributing ideas,\nfor virtual interaction,\nand for mass collaboration on any topic.\nWhile those tools can be used for good,\nthey can also be used for spreading misinformation,\nrevealing private personal information (doxing),\nharassment, and persecution.\nWe will consider these risks in the work we do,\nand will build web technologies and platforms\nthat respect individuals' rights\nand provide features to empower them against dangers like these.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"allpeople\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web is for all people\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nAnyone should be able to meaningfully participate\nin the creation of specifications, user agents, and content,\nand the platform should enable a fully accessible end user experience.\nWe will build internationalization and localization capabilities\ninto our specifications and websites.\nWe will accommodate people on low bandwidth networks and with low specification equipment.\nThe web platform and the tools we use to create it\nmust be accessible to people with disabilities,\nincluding visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"privacy\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nSecurity and privacy are essential\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWhen we add features to the web platform,\nwe are making decisions\nthat may change the ability of people to protect their personal data.\nThis data includes their conversations,\ntheir financial transactions\nand how they live their lives.\nWe will start by creating web technologies\nthat create as few risks as possible,\nand will make sure people understand\nwhat risks they are taking when they use the web.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"expression\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web must enable freedom of expression\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWe will create web technologies and platforms\nthat encourage free expression,\nwhere that does not contravene other human rights.\nOur work should not enable state censorship, <a data-cite=\"RFC7258#section-1\">surveillance</a>\nor other practices that seek to limit this freedom.\nThis principle must be balanced with respect for other human rights,\nand does not imply that individual services on the web must therefore support all speech.\n(For example: hate speech, harassment or abuse may reasonably be denied a platform).\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"verify\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web must make it possible for people to verify the information they see\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWe have a responsibility to build web technologies to counter misinformation,\nallowing information sources to be traceable and facts to be checkable.\nThe concept of origin and source is core to the web's security model.\nWe will make sure the new web technologies we create\ndo not work against this architectural principle.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"control\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web must enhance individuals' control and power\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWe recognize that web technologies can be used\nto manipulate and deceive people, complicate isolation, and encourage addictive behaviors.\nWe seek to mitigate against these potential abuses\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern\">patterns</a>\nwhen creating new technologies and platforms,\nand avoid introducing technologies that increase the chance of\npeople being harmed in this way.\nAs part of this, we favor a decentralized web architecture\nthat minimizes single points of failure and single points of control.\nWe will also build web technologies for individual developers\nas well for developers at large companies and organizations.\nThe web should enable do-it-yourself developers.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"sustainable\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web must be an environmentally sustainable platform\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWeb technologies may have overall positive environmental impacts\nas well as negative impacts,\nand these can change over time and vary geographically as \nboth web and environmental technologies develop.\nWe will endeavor not to do further harm to the environment\nwhen we introduce new technologies to the web, and keep in mind\nthat people most affected by the environmental consequences of new technologies\nmay not be those who benefit from the features introduced.\nThis includes, but is not limited to,\nlowering carbon emissions by minimizing data storage and processing requirements, as well as reducing electronic waste by\nmaximizing the lifespan of physical devices through backwards compatibility.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"transparent\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web is transparent\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nThe web was built on a \"view source\" principle,\ncurrently realized through robust developer tools built into many browsers.\nWe will always make sure it is possible\nto determine how a web application was built\nand how the code works.\nFurthermore, we will always make sure it is possible\nto audit and inspect web applications and underlying software\nfor security, privacy or other considerations.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"multi\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nThe web is multi-browser, multi-OS and multi-device\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nWe will not create web technologies that encourage the creation of websites\nthat work only in one browser,\nor only on particular hardware.\nWe expect that content provided by accessing a URL\n<a data-cite=\"mobile-bp#tc\">should yield a thematically consistent experience</a>\nwhen someone is accessing it from different devices.\nThe existence of multiple interoperable implementations\nenables competition, and thus a variety of choices\nfor web users.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h3 id=\"render\" data-export=\"\" data-dfn-type=\"dfn\">\nPeople should be able to render web content as they want\n  </h3>\n  <p>\nPeople must be able to change web pages according to their needs.\nFor example, people should be able to install style sheets,\nassistive browser extensions,\nand blockers of unwanted content or scripts or auto-played videos.\nWe will build features and write specifications\nthat respect peoples' agency,\nand will create user agents to represent those preferences on the web user's behalf.\n  </p>\n</section>\n","oembed":false,"readabilityObject":{"title":"W3C TAG Ethical Web

therefore consider the ethical consequences of our work.\nThe following document sets out ethical principles\nthat will drive the TAG's continuing work in this direction.\n\n\n\nThis document is a draft Technical Architecture Group (TAG) Finding.\nIt does not contain any normative content.\n\nThis document reflects the consensus of the TAG at the time of publication.\nIt will continue to evolve and the TAG will issue updates as often as needed.\n\n\n## Introduction {#intro}\n\nThe web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society.\nIt has been, and should continue to be, designed\nto enable communication and knowledge-sharing for everyone.\nIn order for the web to continue to be beneficial to society,\nwe need to include ethical thinking when we build\nweb technologies, applications, and sites.\nThe web is made up of a number of technologies and technical standards.\nHTML, CSS and JavaScript are often thought of as the web's core set of technologies\nbut there are a raft of other technologies, standards,\nlanguages and APIs that come together to form the \"web platform.\"\n\nIn the 30 years since development of the web began,\nit has become clear that the web platform can often be used in ways that subvert its original mission,\nor even be used to cause harm.\nThe web should be a platform that helps people\nand provides a net positive social benefit.\nAs we continue to evolve the web platform,\nwe must therefore consider the ethical implications of our work.\nThe web must be for good.\n\nOne of the web platform's differentiators has always been a strong ethical framework;\nfor example an emphasis on\n[internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/),\n[accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/),\n[privacy](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/), and\n[security](https://www.w3.org/Security/).\nWeb technologies are also offered\n[royalty free](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/)\nto enable open source implementation.\nThese are often cited as some of the strengths of the web.\n\nThe architecture of the web is designed with\nthe important notion of different classes of application that retrieve and process content,\nand represent the needs of the application's users.\nThis includes web browsers,\nweb-hosted applications such as search engines,\nand software that acts on web resources.\nThis lends itself well towards empowering people\nby allowing them to choose the browser, search engine, or other application\nthat best meets their needs\n(for example, with strong privacy protections).\n\nThe web should also support human rights, dignity and personal agency.\nWe need to put internationally recognized human rights at the core of the web platform [[?UDHR]].\nAnd we need to promote ethical thinking across the web industry\nto reinforce this approach.\n\nThe principles in this document are deliberately unordered,\nand many are interconnected with each other.\nWhile all of the principles together aim to provide pillars that collectively support\na web that is beneficial for society, there are cases where upholding one principle\nmay diminish the efficacy of another principle.\nThus in applying these principles, there are benefits and tradeoffs\nthat may need to be carefully balanced. When faced with principles\nwhich appear to be in conflict with one another,\nit is important to consider the context in which a particular technology\nis being applied, the expected audience(s) for the technology,\nwho the technology benefits and who it may disadvantage,\nand any power dynamics involved (see also the\npriority of constituencies).\n\nThe purpose of this document is\nto inform TAG review of new specifications\nand candidate additions to published recommendations,\nand to inform other documents such as the\n[[[Design-Principles]]], [[[security-privacy-questionnaire]]]\nor other similar checklists and sets of principles used by specification authors and editors.\nIt also serves to raise awareness of the ethical responsibilities of web makers.\n\n\n## Principles\n\n\n  \nThere is one web\n  \n  \nWhen we are adding new web technologies and platforms,\nwe will build them to cross regional and national boundaries.\nPeople in one location should be able to view web pages\nfrom anywhere that is connected to the web.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nThe web should not cause harm to society\n  \n  \nWhen we are adding a feature or technology to the web,\nwe will consider what harm it could do to society or groups,\nespecially to vulnerable people.\nWe will prioritize potential benefits for web users over potential benefits to web developers,\ncontent providers, user agents, advertisers or others in the ecosystem,\nin line with the\npriority of constituencies.\nWe will ensure the requirements and views of marginalized communities\nand underrepresented groups are heard and respected.\nWe will build new web technologies in a collaborative manner\naccording to open processes\n(for example, the W3C process),\nand adhering to codes of conduct\n(such as the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct).\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \nWe are building technologies and platforms for distributing ideas,\nfor virtual interaction,\nand for mass collaboration on any topic.\nWhile those tools can be used for good,\nthey can also be used for spreading misinformation,\nrevealing private personal information (doxing),\nharassment, and persecution.\nWe will consider these risks in the work we do,\nand will build web technologies and platforms\nthat respect individuals' rights\nand provide features to empower them against dangers like these.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nThe web is for all people\n  \n  \nAnyone should be able to meaningfully participate\nin the creation of specifications, user agents, and content,\nand the platform should enable a fully accessible end user experience.\nWe will build internationalization and localization capabilities\ninto our specifications and websites.\nWe will accommodate people on low bandwidth networks and with low specification equipment.\nThe web platform and the tools we use to create it\nmust be accessible to people with disabilities,\nincluding visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nSecurity and privacy are essential\n  \n  \nWhen we add features to the web platform,\nwe are making decisions\nthat may change the ability of people to protect their personal data.\nThis data includes their conversations,\ntheir financial transactions\nand how they live their lives.\nWe will start by creating web technologies\nthat create as few risks as possible,\nand will make sure people understand\nwhat risks they are taking when they use the web.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nThe web must enable freedom of expression\n  \n  \nWe will create web technologies and platforms\nthat encourage free expression,\nwhere that does not contravene other human rights.\nOur work should not enable state censorship, surveillance\nor other practices that seek to limit this freedom.\nThis principle
