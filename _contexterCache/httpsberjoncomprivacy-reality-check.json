My\n  personal sense is that it's not so much of a war as it is a reality check. It has become very\n  painfully obvious that the same old simple solutions don't work â€” and some people are up in arms\n  that reality is being inconvenient to them.</p>\n<p>Let's take consent, to start somewhere. Consent is just one tool in the privacy toolbox. Consent\n  is a bit like an avocado slicer: when you need to slice an avocado, it's pretty damn good. When\n  you need to bang in a nail, it's pretty damn useless. In the overwhelming majority of everyday\n  privacy contexts, we don't use consent because that would be absurd: is it okay that I listen\n  while you're\n  talking to me? Is it okay that I see you when you enter the room? Is it okay that, as your doctor,\n  I analyse the symptoms you just described to me?</p>\n<p>The answer to problems caused by consent isn't more consent, automated consent, or consent that\n  covers more processing. It's to use consent where and when it is the right tool to increase\n  people's autonomy, and to stop pretending that you can bang nails in with it in all the other\n  cases. And no matter how appealing it might feel on a priori grounds, if it can't be enforced at\n  scale and it is susceptible to hard-to-litigate gaming then it's just a bad approach to data\n  protection. There's a reason why data brokers love consent so much and won't ever stop talking\n  about \"<em>transparency and choice</em>\": it works in favour of whichever party has the time to\n  invest in creating a consent funnel, and that's never individuals.</p>\n<p>All that consent does is that it offloads privacy labour to the user, and only under very\n  specific conditions does it increase the user's autonomy. This isn't new information. There's <a\n    href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/AcquistiBrandimarteLoewenstein-S-2015.pdf\">a\n    review article from </a><em><a\n      href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/AcquistiBrandimarteLoewenstein-S-2015.pdf\">Science</a></em><a\n    href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/AcquistiBrandimarteLoewenstein-S-2015.pdf\"> in\n    2015</a> that brings close to a hundred references to bear on the\n  fact that digital self-determination in the face of privacy issues is highly manipulable and\n  that's even <em>without</em> dark patterns. There are <a\n    href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/more-than-you-wanted-to-know-the-failure-of-mandated-disclosure/9780691161709\">entire\n    books about just the failure of notice regimes</a>. The\n  <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3370433\">pathologies of digital\n    consent</a> are known. Lindsey Barrett summarised the situation well when she described notice\n  and choice as \"<em><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3354129\">a method\n      of privacy regulation which promises transparency and agency but delivers neither.</a></em>\"\n</p>\n<p>Or we could look at the perennial question of pseudonymous data. To people who have no experience\n  in data protection, it sounds pretty reasonable. I mean, it's just a number, what do you really\n  learn about someone? Only just yesterday, <a\n    href=\"https://twitter.com/GerritD/status/1417606494472835078\">a priest was outed using\n    pseudonymous data</a>. There's <a\n    href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnmvz/industry-unmasks-at-scale-maid-to-pii\">an entire\n    industry offering deanonymisation services</a>. Those companies can get quite sophisticated, but\n  the basics of breaking identifiers are straightforward. Reporters â€” smart folks, yes, but not\n  professional data scientists â€” picked up the required skills for <a\n    href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">a\n    stunning report</a> and then other colleagues of them <a\n    href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html\">did\n    it again for another</a>. In fact, Arvind Narayanan recently said that <a\n    href=\"https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1417147060726505475?s=20\">it's so easy to do, you\n    can't even get a research paper published about the practice</a>. Even with rotating keys, the\n  protection is only good if you can protect against timing attacks and have sufficient k-anonymity.\n  You'd think we might learn because <a\n    href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/03/netflix-ditches-1-million-contest-in-wake-of-privacy-suit/\">Netflix\n    very publicly failed at this over ten years ago</a>, as did <a\n    href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html\">AOL in 2006</a>.</p>\n<p>People who should know better are routinely wrong â€” by which I mean <em>mathematically </em>wrong\n  â€” about the safety of identifiers, how do we expect laypeople to meaningfully consent to this?</p>\n<p>Another evergreen proposal is that we can somehow use a web of contracts to ensure\n  self-regulation in the data market. We have that â€” <a\n    href=\"https://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code\">we've had it since 2000</a>. The\n  deal struck in the negotiations that the FTC coordinated in 1999-2000 was essentially that the\n  tracking industry would be allowed to keep operating <a\n    href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100604134130/http://www.ftc.gov/os/2000/07/onlineprofiling.htm\">in\n    exchange for setting up a self-regulatory regime</a>. I don't think it's unreasonable to\n  consider that 20 years is more than enough of a chance for this approach to prove itself. We gave\n  it more than a fair shot; <a\n    href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/when-the-white-house-invoked-the-s-word-it-gave-new-legitimacy-to-surveillance-advertising/\">it's\n    time to call the deal off</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet another recurring contention is that, after two decades of unfettered personal data\n  broadcasting led to some of the most significant market power concentration in the history of\n  humankind, what we really need is more unfettered personal data broadcasting because\n  that will clearly lead to greater competition. There's an emoji for what my face looks like when I\n  try to process that logic, but the Unicode Consortium is afraid to standardise it. I can see that\n  there are non-market factors at play in the current situation, but still: given the empirical\n  evidence, the burden of proof sits squarely with those who make that statement.</p>\n<p>From what I've read, it's not obvious that it is much more than wishful thinking. Data is\n  inherently relational, meaning it forms a network. The value of data depends in large part on its\n  volume and its variety. This can lead to network effects in which, when data is broadly available,\n  having even just a little bit more volume or variety than others <a\n    href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/big-data-and-competition-policy/9780198788140\">can lead to\n    winner-take-all outcomes from network effects</a>. The <a\n    href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sti/data-driven-innovation-9789264229358-en.htm\">OECD's analysis</a>\n  indicated that data enables multi-sided markets which can\n  combine with increased returns to scale and scope, leading to dominance, winner-take-all, and\n  competition for the market rather than in the market. In <a\n    href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/exploring-the-economics-of-personal-data_5k486qtxldmq-en\">a\n    separate study</a>, they point to non-linear returns and network effects, with obvious\n  competition implications.</p>\n<p>And speaking of dysfunctional markets, there's good evidence that the claim that people will\n  enter into a \"<em>value exchange</em>\" involving their data is <a\n    href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2820060\">an imaginary position that\n    only data marketers believe in</a>. People don't see a value exchange, they just hate you in\n  silence. I don't blame anyone for wishing such an exchange existed, but I believe that\n  reality-based marketing works better.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to another trope: that we somehow don't have a definition of privacy. I mean,\n  it's a somewhat contested space, but not <em>that</em> contested. We have <a\n    href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/privacy-in-context-technology-policy-and-the-integrity-of-social-life/9780804752374\">a\n    pretty broadly accepted definition</a> that works very well in the trenches (it's what I've used\n  at The Times for the past four years), that has <a href=\"https://privaci.info/\">its own\n    conference</a>, is <a\n    href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9350695840146257775&amp;as_sdt=5,31&amp;sciodt=0,31&amp;hl=en\">massively\n    cited</a>, and is referenced in <a href=\"https://www.bitbybitbook.com/\">social and data science\n    textbooks</a>. I <a\n    href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-thinks-about-your-privacy-bc07d2171531\">covered\n    it for a general audience</a>. I also <a href=\"https://darobin.github.io/pup/\">introduced it for\n    use in a standards\n    context</a>, which hopefully <a href=\"https://tag.w3.org/\">TAG</a>/<a\n    href=\"https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/\">PING</a> can find some consensus around soon.</p>\n<p>I could keep going, but this might be enough of a literature review for today. The way I see it,\n  we have a pretty straightforward choice. We can keep loudly blustering that doing more of exactly\n  what we've done for the past two decades will somehow magically lead to different outcomes,\n  or we can actually bite the bullet, whether we like it or not, and find solutions that actually\n  work.</p>\n<p>Detractors often depict privacy work as being \"<em>ideological.</em>\" If believing that people\n  shouldn't live in fear of their tech betraying them is ideological, I'll take it. But there's a\n  purely profits-driven consideration if that's what you want: people don't want to be recognised\n  across contexts, and trying to force that to happen is an arms race against users which you'll\n  eventually lose.</p>\n<p>I know that these are not easy changes. We have yet to scale a business model that does not rely\n  on advertising (subscriptions are <em>highly</em> reliant on it), and much of advertising has, for\n  a while, been privacy-hostile. Changing that is a big reinvention.

My\n  personal sense is that it's not so much of a war as it is a reality check. It has become very\n  painfully obvious that the same old simple solutions don't work â€” and some people are up in arms\n  that reality is being inconvenient to them.</p>\n<p>Let's take consent, to start somewhere. Consent is just one tool in the privacy toolbox. Consent\n  is a bit like an avocado slicer: when you need to slice an avocado, it's pretty damn good. When\n  you need to bang in a nail, it's pretty damn useless. In the overwhelming majority of everyday\n  privacy contexts, we don't use consent because that would be absurd: is it okay that I listen\n  while you're\n  talking to me? Is it okay that I see you when you enter the room? Is it okay that, as your doctor,\n  I analyse the symptoms you just described to me?</p>\n<p>The answer to problems caused by consent isn't more consent, automated consent, or consent that\n  covers more processing. It's to use consent where and when it is the right tool to increase\n  people's autonomy, and to stop pretending that you can bang nails in with it in all the other\n  cases. And no matter how appealing it might feel on a priori grounds, if it can't be enforced at\n  scale and it is susceptible to hard-to-litigate gaming then it's just a bad approach to data\n  protection. There's a reason why data brokers love consent so much and won't ever stop talking\n  about \"<em>transparency and choice</em>\": it works in favour of whichever party has the time to\n  invest in creating a consent funnel, and that's never individuals.</p>\n<p>All that consent does is that it offloads privacy labour to the user, and only under very\n  specific conditions does it increase the user's autonomy. This isn't new information. There's <a href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/AcquistiBrandimarteLoewenstein-S-2015.pdf\">a\n    review article from </a><em><a href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/AcquistiBrandimarteLoewenstein-S-2015.pdf\">Science</a></em><a href=\"https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/AcquistiBrandimarteLoewenstein-S-2015.pdf\"> in\n    2015</a> that brings close to a hundred references to bear on the\n  fact that digital self-determination in the face of privacy issues is highly manipulable and\n  that's even <em>without</em> dark patterns. There are <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/more-than-you-wanted-to-know-the-failure-of-mandated-disclosure/9780691161709\">entire\n    books about just the failure of notice regimes</a>. The\n  <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3370433\">pathologies of digital\n    consent</a> are known. Lindsey Barrett summarised the situation well when she described notice\n  and choice as \"<em><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3354129\">a method\n      of privacy regulation which promises transparency and agency but delivers neither.</a></em>\"\n</p>\n<p>Or we could look at the perennial question of pseudonymous data. To people who have no experience\n  in data protection, it sounds pretty reasonable. I mean, it's just a number, what do you really\n  learn about someone? Only just yesterday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GerritD/status/1417606494472835078\">a priest was outed using\n    pseudonymous data</a>. There's <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnmvz/industry-unmasks-at-scale-maid-to-pii\">an entire\n    industry offering deanonymisation services</a>. Those companies can get quite sophisticated, but\n  the basics of breaking identifiers are straightforward. Reporters â€” smart folks, yes, but not\n  professional data scientists â€” picked up the required skills for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">a\n    stunning report</a> and then other colleagues of them <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html\">did\n    it again for another</a>. In fact, Arvind Narayanan recently said that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1417147060726505475?s=20\">it's so easy to do, you\n    can't even get a research paper published about the practice</a>. Even with rotating keys, the\n  protection is only good if you can protect against timing attacks and have sufficient k-anonymity.\n  You'd think we might learn because <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/03/netflix-ditches-1-million-contest-in-wake-of-privacy-suit/\">Netflix\n    very publicly failed at this over ten years ago</a>, as did <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html\">AOL in 2006</a>.</p>\n<p>People who should know better are routinely wrong â€” by which I mean <em>mathematically </em>wrong\n  â€” about the safety of identifiers, how do we expect laypeople to meaningfully consent to this?</p>\n<p>Another evergreen proposal is that we can somehow use a web of contracts to ensure\n  self-regulation in the data market. We have that â€” <a href=\"https://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code\">we've had it since 2000</a>. The\n  deal struck in the negotiations that the FTC coordinated in 1999-2000 was essentially that the\n  tracking industry would be allowed to keep operating <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100604134130/http://www.ftc.gov/os/2000/07/onlineprofiling.htm\">in\n    exchange for setting up a self-regulatory regime</a>. I don't think it's unreasonable to\n  consider that 20 years is more than enough of a chance for this approach to prove itself. We gave\n  it more than a fair shot; <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/when-the-white-house-invoked-the-s-word-it-gave-new-legitimacy-to-surveillance-advertising/\">it's\n    time to call the deal off</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet another recurring contention is that, after two decades of unfettered personal data\n  broadcasting led to some of the most significant market power concentration in the history of\n  humankind, what we really need is more unfettered personal data broadcasting because\n  that will clearly lead to greater competition. There's an emoji for what my face looks like when I\n  try to process that logic, but the Unicode Consortium is afraid to standardise it. I can see that\n  there are non-market factors at play in the current situation, but still: given the empirical\n  evidence, the burden of proof sits squarely with those who make that statement.</p>\n<p>From what I've read, it's not obvious that it is much more than wishful thinking. Data is\n  inherently relational, meaning it forms a network. The value of data depends in large part on its\n  volume and its variety. This can lead to network effects in which, when data is broadly available,\n  having even just a little bit more volume or variety than others <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/big-data-and-competition-policy/9780198788140\">can lead to\n    winner-take-all outcomes from network effects</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sti/data-driven-innovation-9789264229358-en.htm\">OECD's analysis</a>\n  indicated that data enables multi-sided markets which can\n  combine with increased returns to scale and scope, leading to dominance, winner-take-all, and\n  competition for the market rather than in the market. In <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/exploring-the-economics-of-personal-data_5k486qtxldmq-en\">a\n    separate study</a>, they point to non-linear returns and network effects, with obvious\n  competition implications.</p>\n<p>And speaking of dysfunctional markets, there's good evidence that the claim that people will\n  enter into a \"<em>value exchange</em>\" involving their data is <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2820060\">an imaginary position that\n    only data marketers believe in</a>. People don't see a value exchange, they just hate you in\n  silence. I don't blame anyone for wishing such an exchange existed, but I believe that\n  reality-based marketing works better.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to another trope: that we somehow don't have a definition of privacy. I mean,\n  it's a somewhat contested space, but not <em>that</em> contested. We have <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/privacy-in-context-technology-policy-and-the-integrity-of-social-life/9780804752374\">a\n    pretty broadly accepted definition</a> that works very well in the trenches (it's what I've used\n  at The Times for the past four years), that has <a href=\"https://privaci.info/\">its own\n    conference</a>, is <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9350695840146257775&amp;as_sdt=5,31&amp;sciodt=0,31&amp;hl=en\">massively\n    cited</a>, and is referenced in <a href=\"https://www.bitbybitbook.com/\">social and data science\n    textbooks</a>. I <a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-thinks-about-your-privacy-bc07d2171531\">covered\n    it for a general audience</a>. I also <a href=\"https://darobin.github.io/pup/\">introduced it for\n    use in a standards\n    context</a>, which hopefully <a href=\"https://tag.w3.org/\">TAG</a>/<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/\">PING</a> can find some consensus around soon.</p>\n<p>I could keep going, but this might be enough of a literature review for today. The way I see it,\n  we have a pretty straightforward choice. We can keep loudly blustering that doing more of exactly\n  what we've done for the past two decades will somehow magically lead to different outcomes,\n  or we can actually bite the bullet, whether we like it or not, and find solutions that actually\n  work.</p>\n<p>Detractors often depict privacy work as being \"<em>ideological.</em>\" If believing that people\n  shouldn't live in fear of their tech betraying them is ideological, I'll take it. But there's a\n  purely profits-driven consideration if that's what you want: people don't want to be recognised\n  across contexts, and trying to force that to happen is an arms race against users which you'll\n  eventually lose.</p>\n<p>I know that these are not easy changes. We have yet to scale a business model that does not rely\n  on advertising (subscriptions are <em>highly</em> reliant on it), and much of advertising has, for\n  a while, been privacy-hostile. Changing that is a big reinvention. But we need to reform data and\n  advertising, despite the complexity and the risk, because it's the only discernible path forward\n  that has any sustainability to it.</p>\n<p>So with this in mind, I'd like to suggest that we stop wasting time revisiting the failed\n  strategies of a broken system, and instead invest in making it work.
