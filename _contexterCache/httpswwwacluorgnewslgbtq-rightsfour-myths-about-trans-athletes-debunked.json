mb-8 is-rich-text\">\n\t  <p>For years state lawmakers have pushed legislation attempting to shut trans people out of public spaces. In 2020, lawmakers zeroed in on sports and introduced <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/documents/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country-2021\">20 bills</a> seeking to ban trans people from participating in athletics. These statewide efforts have been supported through a coordinated campaign led by anti-LGBTQ groups that have long worked to attack our communities.</p>\n<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down most state legislatures, Idaho became the first state to pass a sweeping ban on trans people’s participation in athletics from kindergarten through college. We, along with our partners, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/hecox-v-little\">immediately sued</a>. Advocates across the country are gearing up to continue the fight against these harmful bills in legislatures when they reconvene. In Connecticut, the ACLU is <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/soule-et-al-v-ct-association-schools-et-al\">defending the rights of transgender athletes</a> in a lawsuit brought by cisgender athletes seeking to strike down the state’s inclusive policy.</p>\n<p>Though we are fighting every day in the courts and in legislatures, upholding trans rights will take more than judicial and legislative action. It will require rooting out the inaccurate and harmful beliefs underlying these policies. Below, we debunk four myths about trans athletes using the expertise of doctors, academics, and sports psychologists serving as experts in our <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/hecox-v-little\">litigation in Idaho</a>.</p>\n  </div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h2 with-standard\">FACT: Including trans athletes will benefit everyone.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h4 with-standard\">MYTH: The participation of trans athletes hurts cis women.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n  <div class=\"wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text\">\n\t  <p>Many who oppose the inclusion of trans athletes erroneously claim that allowing trans athletes to compete will harm cisgender women. This divide and conquer tactic gets it exactly wrong. Excluding women who are trans hurts all women. It invites gender policing that could subject any woman to invasive tests or accusations of being “too masculine” or “too good” at their sport to be a “real” woman. In Idaho, the ACLU represents two young women, one trans and one cis, both of whom are hurt by the law that was passed targeting trans athletes.</p>\n<p>Further, this myth <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/banning-trans-girls-school-sports-neither-feminist-nor-legal\">reinforces stereotypes</a> that women are weak and in need of protection. Politicians have used the “protection” trope time and time again, including in 2016 when they tried banning trans people from public restrooms by creating the debunked <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/sexual-assault-domestic-violence-organizations-debunk-bathroom-predator/story?id=38604019\">“bathroom predator”</a> myth. The real motive is never about protection — it’s about excluding trans people from yet another public space. The arena of sports is no different.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, including trans athletes will promote values of non-discrimination and inclusion among all student athletes. As longtime coach and sports policy expert Helen Carroll explains, efforts to exclude subsets of girls from sports, “can <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-carroll-declaration\">undermine team unity</a> and also encourage divisiveness by policing who is ‘really’ a girl.” Dr. Mary Fry adds that youth derive the most benefits from athletics when they are exposed to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-fry-declaration\">caring environments</a> where teammates are supported by each other and by coaches. Banning some girls from athletics because they are transgender undermines this cohesion and compromises the wide-ranging benefits that youth get from sports.</p>\n  </div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h2 with-standard\">FACT: Trans athletes do not have an unfair advantage in sports.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h4 with-standard\">MYTH: Trans athletes’ physiological characteristics provide an unfair advantage over cis athletes.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n  <div class=\"wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text\">\n\t  <p>Women and girls who are trans face discrimination and violence that makes it difficult to even stay in school. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports#USTS\">U.S. Trans Survey</a>, 22 percent of trans women who were perceived as trans in school were harassed so badly they had to leave school because of it. Another 10 percent were kicked out of school. The idea that women and girls have an <em>advantage </em>because they are trans ignores the actual conditions of their lives.</p>\n<p>Trans athletes vary in athletic ability just like cisgender athletes. “One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,” explains <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/banning-trans-girls-school-sports-neither-feminist-nor-legal\">Andraya Yearwood</a>, a student track athlete and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/soule-et-al-v-ct-association-schools-et-al\">ACLU client</a>. “One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster,\" she adds. In Connecticut, where cisgender girl runners have tried to block Andraya from participating in the sport she loves, the very same cis girls who have claimed that trans athletes have an “unfair” advantage have consistently performed as well as or better than transgender competitors.</p>\n<p>\"A person’s genetic make-up and internal and external reproductive anatomy are <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-safer-declaration\">not useful indicators</a> of athletic performance,”according to Dr. Joshua D. Safer. “For a trans woman athlete who meets <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Transgender_Handbook_2011_Final.pdf\">NCAA standards</a>, “there is no inherent reason why her physiological characteristics related to athletic performance should be treated differently from the physiological characteristics of a non-transgender woman.”</p>\n  </div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h2 with-standard\">FACT: Trans girls are girls.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h4 with-standard\">MYTH: Sex is binary, apparent at birth, and identifiable through singular biological characteristics.&nbsp;</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n  <div class=\"wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text\">\n\t  <p>Girls who are trans are told repeatedly that they are not “real” girls and boys who are trans are told they are not “real” boys. Non-binary people are told that their gender is not real and that they must be either boys or girls. None of these statements are true. Trans people are exactly who we say we are.</p>\n<p>There is no one way for women’s bodies to be. Women, including women who are transgender, intersex, or disabled, have a range of different physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>“A person’s sex is made up of multiple biological characteristics and they <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-safer-declaration\">may not all align</a> as typically male or female in a given person,” says Dr. Safer. Further, many people who are not trans can have hormones levels outside of the range considered typical of a cis person of their assigned sex.</p>\n<p>When a person does not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, they must be able to transition socially — and that includes participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. According to Dr. Deanna Adkins, excluding trans athletes can be <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-adkins-declaration\">deeply harmful and disruptive</a> to treatment. “I know from experience with my patients that it can be extremely harmful for a transgender young person to be excluded from the team consistent with their gender identity.”</p>\n  </div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h2 with-standard\">FACT: Trans people belong on the same teams as other students.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-8\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h4 with-standard\">MYTH: Trans students need separate teams.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n  <div class=\"wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text\">\n\t  <p>Trans people have the same right to play sports as anybody else. “For the past nine years,” <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-carroll-declaration\">explains Carroll</a>, “transgender athletes have been able to compete on teams at NCAA member collegiates and universities consistent with their gender identity like all other student-athletes with no disruption to women’s collegiate sports.”</p>\n<p>Excluding trans people from any space or activity is harmful, particularly for trans youth. A trans high school student, for example, may experience <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/\">detrimental effects</a> to their physical and emotional wellbeing when they are pushed out of affirming spaces and communities. As Lindsay Hecox says, <a href=\"https://www.acluidaho.org/en/press-releases/aclu-legal-voice-file-lawsuit-challenging-idahos-law-targeting-transgender-student\">“I just want to run.”</p>\n<p></a>According to Dr. Adkins, “When a school or athletic organization denies transgender students the ability to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-adkins-declaration\">participate equally</a> in athletics because they are transgender, that condones, reinforces, and affirms the transgender students’ social status as outsiders or misfits who deserve the hostility they experience from peers.”</p>\n<p>Believing and perpetuating myths and misconceptions about trans athletes is harmful. Denying trans people the right to participate is discrimination and it doesn’t just hurt trans people, it hurts all of us.</p>\n

rejected a preliminary injunction request, allowing enforcement of a new Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) policy aimed at withholding gender-affirming medical care to those diagnosed with gender dysphoria and forcing transgender women into their male gender assigned at birth.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Florida Department of Corrections issued a bulletin setting new rules for the medical care that the department would provide to transgender people in its custody who had received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Contrary to the medical mainstream, the bulletin suggests those seeking hormone therapy may have endured “short-termed delusions or beliefs which may later be changed and reversed” and recommended against providing any gender-affirming medical care unless extensive barriers are overcome.\nThat same day, at Florida Department of Corrections facilities across the state, transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria were rounded up and informed that FDC policy had been changed, “up to and including hormone therapy.” They were specifically told that they would no longer have access to clothing and grooming standards that accord with their gender identity and would have 30 days to comply.\nTransgender women were told that those who did not cut their hair in compliance with male grooming standards would be forcibly shorn, and those who did not turn in their female undergarments and feminine canteen items would be disciplined. Transgender women were forced to have their breasts examined to determine if their breasts were large enough, in the eyes of the department, to require a bra.\n“Florida officials are waging a baseless campaign to dehumanize and degrade incarcerated people like our client,” said Li Nowlin-Sohl, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s LGBTQ + HIV Project. “Allowing this policy to move forward threatens the basic human rights of transgender people in the state’s custody and the court’s order today affords the state’s policy more credulity than it deserves when the clear intent of the state is to ban this health care outright.”\nIn October 2024, the ACLU and the ACLU of Florida filed emergency litigation on behalf of Reiyn Keohane – a transgender woman in the custody of the department who has been receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy and clothing and grooming accommodations since 2016 – and a proposed class of transgender inmates with gender dysphoria, on the grounds that the new policy constitutes a violation of their Eighth Amendment right to medically necessary care. The ACLU and ACLU of Florida previously filed a 2016 lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Keohane that led to the now-rescinded policy permitting access to hormone therapy and female clothing and grooming standards for transgender women in FDC custody, which for more than six years permitted hundreds of transgender inmates to access needed gender-affirming care.            </div>\n                            <div class=\"mt-3\">\n                            <div class=\"card__metadata is-flex is-flex-direction-row is-justify-content-flex-start is-size-7 mt-1\">\n                    <span class=\"line-clamp-1\"><b>Court Case:</b> Keohane v.

The American Civil Liberties Union is opposing final passage of the defense bill over the inclusion of this health care ban and calling on President Joe Biden to veto the bill.\nSection 708 of the NDAA would prohibit insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria” such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressant medications, which Speaker Mike Johnson says would “permanently ban transgender medical treatment for minors.” The same treatments would be covered by TRICARE for any medical purpose other than treating gender dysphoria, the clinical diagnosis for the psychological distress experienced by transgender people related to their gender identity.\n“By passing this bill, the House and Senate are forcing thousands of active-duty service members to choose between their careers in the military and the future of their transgender children,” said Mike Zamore, national director of policy &amp; government affairs at the ACLU. “This unconscionable and unjustifiable attack on those families stands in direct contrast to President Joe Biden’s legacy of defending the civil rights of transgender Americans — including when few in his own party showed the courage to do so. President Biden should cement his legacy by vetoing this bill and sending it back to Congress to pass without Speaker Johnson’s last minute health care ban for servicemembers’ kids.”\nIf signed by President Biden, this health care ban would be the first new anti-LGBTQ provision enacted by Congress and signed into law by the president since the enactment of the military’s since-repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy for LGBTQ servicemembers and the since-repealed federal law barring recognition of same-sex marriages known as the Defense of Marriage Act.\nIt is unknown how many transgender youth are currently enrolled in TRICARE or how many of those enrolled are currently receiving coverage for gender-affirming care. In one 2022 analysis, 2,500 minor patients sought care for gender dysphoria through TRICARE Prime insurance at military or civilian treatment facilities in 2017, and 900 received puberty suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a landmark case brought by the ACLU, the ACLU of Tennessee, Lambda Legal, and Akin Gump on behalf of three families and a medical provider challenging a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming hormonal therapies for transgender youth on the grounds the ban violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.            </div>\n                    </div>\n\n\t\n<a\n    href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/president-biden-must-veto-defense-bill-attacking-military-families-with-transgender-youth\"\n    class=\"blocklink\"\n        aria-label=\"President Biden Must Veto Defense Bill Attacking Military Families with Transgender Youth\"\n>\n    <span class=\"screenreader-only\">President Biden Must Veto Defense Bill Attacking Military Families with Transgender Youth</span>\n</a></div>                </li>\n                            <li class=\"column is-one-quarter-desktop pb-0 pb-4-desktop\">\n                    \n\n<div class=\"card card__vertical is-flex is-flex-direction-column blocklink-container is-relative \">\n    \n<div class=\"card__top is-flex is-flex-direction-row is-justify-content-space-between is-align-items-center has-font-family-standard is-size-7 is-mobile px-4 py-3 mb-none mt-none\">\n    <div class=\"is-flex pt-none pb-none is-flex-direction-row is-justify-content-flex-start is-align-items-center\">\n        <div\n            class=\"mb-1 \n            has-press-release-icon has-press-release-icon__black\"\n        ></div>\n        <div class=\"ml-2\">\n            Press Release                    </div>\n    </div>\n            <div class=\"card__top__date has-text-right ml-1 pl-none pt-none pb-none pr-none nowrap\">\n            Dec 2024        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n<div class=\"card__image mb-0 mt-0\">\n     <!-- IMAGE FALLBACK -->\n        <img src='https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-links/fallback-press-release.png' alt='Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People&#039;s Birth Certificates and Driver&#039;s Licenses' />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"card__issues is-flex is-flex-direction-row nowrap overflow-hidden is-relative is-size-7 py-1 px-4 \">\n                    <p>LGBTQ Rights</p>\n            </div>\n\n    <div class=\"card__body px-4 pb-6 mb-none top_padding__with_issues_tag\">\n        <div class=\"is-flex is-flex-direction-row is-justify-content-flex-start is-align-items-center\">\n            <h3 class=\"card__title is-size-4 has-font-family-compressed line-clamp-3\">\n                Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People's Birth Certificates and Driver's Licenses            </h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"card__description is-size-6 mt-3 line-clamp-3\">\n            HELENA, Mont. – A Montana court has granted a preliminary injunction preventing the state of Montana from enforcing policies that bar transgender people from obtaining accurate sex designations on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses.\nAfter a prior restriction on amendments of birth certificates was struck down by the courts, in early 2024 the state of Montana enacted a new rule that categorically bars transgender Montanans from correcting the sex designation on their birth certificates.  Around the same time, the Montana Department of Justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver’s licenses. The plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.\nIn a recent Montana Supreme Court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status – as the state is engaging in here – is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Montana Constitution’s equal protection clause.\nThe plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP.\nPlaintiff Jessica Kalarchik, a veteran who served in the United States Army for 31 years, said: “After finally being able to live my life openly as the woman I know myself to be, I am frustrated that my birth state, Montana, wants me to carry around a birth certificate that incorrectly lists my sex as male. I live my life openly as a woman, I am treated as a woman in my daily life, and there is no reason I should be forced to carry a birth certificate that incorrectly identifies me as male. Fortunately, the court agrees that this ridiculous policy should not be in effect.”\n“Once again the State of Montana chose to adopt a draconian policy that is clearly intended to marginalize transgender Montanans, only for that discriminatory action to be blocked by the courts,” said Akilah Deernose, executive director for the ACLU of Montana. “Here in Montana we treasure our right to privacy and to live our lives free from governmental intrusion. The State of Montana clearly has not learned any lessons from the past few years, where courts have repeatedly struck down unconstitutional laws targeting transgender Montanans.”\n“Forcing anyone to carry documents that contradict their identity unjustly violates their rights to privacy, equal treatment, and not being compelled to convey a government message about their sex that they disagree with,” said Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the ACLU’s LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project. “Such a policy marks transgender people for further mistreatment and discrimination, essentially requiring them to carry papers that out them as transgender any time they need to provide identity documents. Fortunately, the court has refused to allow the state of Montana to subvert the freedom of transgender Montanans to control their own identity as this case goes forward.”\nIn granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the court held, “[i]f the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate the basis of sex.”\nThe state has the option of appealing the district court’s ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, but the underlying case will proceed in district court. A trial has not yet been scheduled.            </div>\n                            <div class=\"mt-3\">\n                            <div class=\"card__metadata is-flex is-flex-direction-row is-justify-content-flex-start is-size-7 mt-1\">\n                    <span class=\"line-clamp-1\"><b>Court Case:</b> Kalarchik v.

In 2020, lawmakers zeroed in on sports and introduced <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/documents/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country-2021\">20 bills</a> seeking to ban trans people from participating in athletics. These statewide efforts have been supported through a coordinated campaign led by anti-LGBTQ groups that have long worked to attack our communities.</p>\n<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down most state legislatures, Idaho became the first state to pass a sweeping ban on trans people’s participation in athletics from kindergarten through college. We, along with our partners, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/hecox-v-little\">immediately sued</a>. Advocates across the country are gearing up to continue the fight against these harmful bills in legislatures when they reconvene. In Connecticut, the ACLU is <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/soule-et-al-v-ct-association-schools-et-al\">defending the rights of transgender athletes</a> in a lawsuit brought by cisgender athletes seeking to strike down the state’s inclusive policy.</p>\n<p>Though we are fighting every day in the courts and in legislatures, upholding trans rights will take more than judicial and legislative action. It will require rooting out the inaccurate and harmful beliefs underlying these policies. Below, we debunk four myths about trans athletes using the expertise of doctors, academics, and sports psychologists serving as experts in our <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/hecox-v-little\">litigation in Idaho</a>.</p>\n  </div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\">FACT: Including trans athletes will benefit everyone.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\">MYTH: The participation of trans athletes hurts cis women.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n  <div>\n\t  <p>Many who oppose the inclusion of trans athletes erroneously claim that allowing trans athletes to compete will harm cisgender women. This divide and conquer tactic gets it exactly wrong. Excluding women who are trans hurts all women. It invites gender policing that could subject any woman to invasive tests or accusations of being “too masculine” or “too good” at their sport to be a “real” woman. In Idaho, the ACLU represents two young women, one trans and one cis, both of whom are hurt by the law that was passed targeting trans athletes.</p>\n<p>Further, this myth <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/banning-trans-girls-school-sports-neither-feminist-nor-legal\">reinforces stereotypes</a> that women are weak and in need of protection. Politicians have used the “protection” trope time and time again, including in 2016 when they tried banning trans people from public restrooms by creating the debunked <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/sexual-assault-domestic-violence-organizations-debunk-bathroom-predator/story?id=38604019\">“bathroom predator”</a> myth. The real motive is never about protection — it’s about excluding trans people from yet another public space. The arena of sports is no different.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, including trans athletes will promote values of non-discrimination and inclusion among all student athletes. As longtime coach and sports policy expert Helen Carroll explains, efforts to exclude subsets of girls from sports, “can <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-carroll-declaration\">undermine team unity</a> and also encourage divisiveness by policing who is ‘really’ a girl.” Dr. Mary Fry adds that youth derive the most benefits from athletics when they are exposed to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-fry-declaration\">caring environments</a> where teammates are supported by each other and by coaches. Banning some girls from athletics because they are transgender undermines this cohesion and compromises the wide-ranging benefits that youth get from sports.</p>\n  </div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\">FACT: Trans athletes do not have an unfair advantage in sports.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\">MYTH: Trans athletes’ physiological characteristics provide an unfair advantage over cis athletes.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n  <div>\n\t  <p>Women and girls who are trans face discrimination and violence that makes it difficult to even stay in school. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports#USTS\">U.S. Trans Survey</a>, 22 percent of trans women who were perceived as trans in school were harassed so badly they had to leave school because of it. Another 10 percent were kicked out of school. The idea that women and girls have an <em>advantage </em>because they are trans ignores the actual conditions of their lives.</p>\n<p>Trans athletes vary in athletic ability just like cisgender athletes. “One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,” explains <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/banning-trans-girls-school-sports-neither-feminist-nor-legal\">Andraya Yearwood</a>, a student track athlete and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/soule-et-al-v-ct-association-schools-et-al\">ACLU client</a>. “One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster,\" she adds. In Connecticut, where cisgender girl runners have tried to block Andraya from participating in the sport she loves, the very same cis girls who have claimed that trans athletes have an “unfair” advantage have consistently performed as well as or better than transgender competitors.</p>\n<p>\"A person’s genetic make-up and internal and external reproductive anatomy are <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-safer-declaration\">not useful indicators</a> of athletic performance,”according to Dr. Joshua D. Safer. “For a trans woman athlete who meets <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Transgender_Handbook_2011_Final.pdf\">NCAA standards</a>, “there is no inherent reason why her physiological characteristics related to athletic performance should be treated differently from the physiological characteristics of a non-transgender woman.”</p>\n  </div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\">FACT: Trans girls are girls.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\">MYTH: Sex is binary, apparent at birth, and identifiable through singular biological characteristics.&nbsp;</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n  <div>\n\t  <p>Girls who are trans are told repeatedly that they are not “real” girls and boys who are trans are told they are not “real” boys.

Women, including women who are transgender, intersex, or disabled, have a range of different physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>“A person’s sex is made up of multiple biological characteristics and they <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-safer-declaration\">may not all align</a> as typically male or female in a given person,” says Dr. Safer. Further, many people who are not trans can have hormones levels outside of the range considered typical of a cis person of their assigned sex.</p>\n<p>When a person does not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, they must be able to transition socially — and that includes participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. According to Dr. Deanna Adkins, excluding trans athletes can be <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-adkins-declaration\">deeply harmful and disruptive</a> to treatment. “I know from experience with my patients that it can be extremely harmful for a transgender young person to be excluded from the team consistent with their gender identity.”</p>\n  </div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\">FACT: Trans people belong on the same teams as other students.</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 id=\"\">MYTH: Trans students need separate teams.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n  <div>\n\t  <p>Trans people have the same right to play sports as anybody else. “For the past nine years,” <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-carroll-declaration\">explains Carroll</a>, “transgender athletes have been able to compete on teams at NCAA member collegiates and universities consistent with their gender identity like all other student-athletes with no disruption to women’s collegiate sports.”</p>\n<p>Excluding trans people from any space or activity is harmful, particularly for trans youth. A trans high school student, for example, may experience <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/\">detrimental effects</a> to their physical and emotional wellbeing when they are pushed out of affirming spaces and communities. As Lindsay Hecox says, <a href=\"https://www.acluidaho.org/en/press-releases/aclu-legal-voice-file-lawsuit-challenging-idahos-law-targeting-transgender-student\">“I just want to run.”</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.acluidaho.org/en/press-releases/aclu-legal-voice-file-lawsuit-challenging-idahos-law-targeting-transgender-student\"></a>According to Dr. Adkins, “When a school or athletic organization denies transgender students the ability to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-adkins-declaration\">participate equally</a> in athletics because they are transgender, that condones, reinforces, and affirms the transgender students’ social status as outsiders or misfits who deserve the hostility they experience from peers.”</p>\n<p>Believing and perpetuating myths and misconceptions about trans athletes is harmful. Denying trans people the right to participate is discrimination and it doesn’t just hurt trans people, it hurts all of us.</p>\n  </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<dynamiccta :cta=\"{&quot;cta_type&quot;:&quot;other_action&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Support Trans Athletes&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/action.aclu.org\\/petition\\/support-trans-student-athletes?ms_aff=NAT&amp;initms_aff=NAT&amp;ms=190726_lgbtrights_transathletepledge&amp;initms=190726_lgbtrights_transathletepledge&amp;ms_chan=web&amp;initms_chan=web&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Add your name&quot;,&quot;time_commitment&quot;:&quot;short-time&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:[{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;1x1_600&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/assets.aclu.org\\/live\\/uploads\\/2018\\/11\\/Trans_Student_Athlete_Pledge_600x600-600x600.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:302},{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;1x1_400&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/assets.aclu.org\\/live\\/uploads\\/2018\\/11\\/Trans_Student_Athlete_Pledge_600x600-400x400.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:400,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:302}]}}\" :issue=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;LGBTQ Rights&quot;,&quot;image_tag&quot;:&quot;<img width=\\&quot;700\\&quot; height=\\&quot;350\\&quot; src=\\&quot;https:\\/\\/assets.aclu.org\\/live\\/uploads\\/2022\\/02\\/lgbtq-issue-image.jpg\\&quot; class=\\&quot;attachment-full size-full\\&quot; alt=\\&quot;LGBTQ issue image\\&quot; decoding=\\&quot;async\\&quot; loading=\\&quot;lazy\\&quot; srcset=\\&quot;https:\\/\\/assets.aclu.org\\/live\\/uploads\\/2022\\/02\\/lgbtq-issue-image.jpg 700w, https:\\/\\/assets.aclu.org\\/live\\/uploads\\/2022\\/02\\/lgbtq-issue-image-400x200.jpg 400w, https:\\/\\/assets.aclu.org\\/live\\/uploads\\/2022\\/02\\/lgbtq-issue-image-600x300.jpg 600w\\&quot; sizes=\\&quot;auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\&quot; \\/>&quot;}\"></dynamiccta>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<!-- Issue Tags Section -->\n\t\t\t\n    \n\n\t\t\t<!-- Related Content Section -->\n\t\t\t\n    <section>\n                    <p>\n                <h2>\n                    <span>Related Content</span>\n                </h2>\n            </p>\n                <ul>\n                            <li>\n                    \n\n                </li>\n                            <li>\n                    \n\n<div>\n    \n\n    \n<p><img src=\"https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-links/fallback-press-release.png\" alt=\"Florida Judge Allows State Prison Officials to Withhold Medical Care for Transgender Incarcerated People\">\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>LGBTQ Rights</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <p>\n            <h3>\n                Florida Judge Allows State Prison Officials to Withhold Medical Care for Transgender Incarcerated People            </h3>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n            TALLAHASSEE – A federal district court judge has rejected a preliminary injunction request, allowing enforcement of a new Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) policy aimed at withholding gender-affirming medical care to those diagnosed with gender dysphoria and forcing transgender women into their male gender assigned at birth.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Florida Department of Corrections issued a bulletin setting new rules for the medical care that the department would provide to transgender people in its custody who had received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Contrary to the medical mainstream, the bulletin suggests those seeking hormone therapy may have endured “short-termed delusions or beliefs which may later be changed and reversed” and recommended against providing any gender-affirming medical care unless extensive barriers are overcome.\nThat same day, at Florida Department of Corrections facilities across the state, transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria were rounded up and informed that FDC policy had been changed, “up to and including hormone therapy.” They were specifically told that they would no longer have access to clothing and grooming standards that accord with their gender identity and would have 30 days to comply.\nTransgender women were told that those who did not cut their hair in compliance with male grooming standards would be forcibly shorn, and those who did not turn in their female undergarments and feminine canteen items would be disciplined. Transgender women were forced to have their breasts examined to determine if their breasts were large enough, in the eyes of the department, to require a bra.\n“Florida officials are waging a baseless campaign to dehumanize and degrade incarcerated people like our client,” said Li Nowlin-Sohl, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s LGBTQ + HIV Project. “Allowing this policy to move forward threatens the basic human rights of transgender people in the state’s custody and the court’s order today affords the state’s policy more credulity than it deserves when the clear intent of the state is to ban this health care outright.”\nIn October 2024, the ACLU and the ACLU of Florida filed emergency litigation on behalf of Reiyn Keohane – a transgender woman in the custody of the department who has been receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy and clothing and grooming accommodations since 2016 – and a proposed class of transgender inmates with gender dysphoria, on the grounds that the new policy constitutes a violation of their Eighth Amendment right to medically necessary care. The ACLU and ACLU of Florida previously filed a 2016 lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Keohane that led to the now-rescinded policy permitting access to hormone therapy and female clothing and grooming standards for transgender women in FDC custody, which for more than six years permitted hundreds of transgender inmates to access needed gender-affirming care.            </p>\n                            <div>\n                            <p><span><b>Court Case:</b> Keohane v.

The American Civil Liberties Union is opposing final passage of the defense bill over the inclusion of this health care ban and calling on President Joe Biden to veto the bill.\nSection 708 of the NDAA would prohibit insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria” such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressant medications, which Speaker Mike Johnson says would “permanently ban transgender medical treatment for minors.” The same treatments would be covered by TRICARE for any medical purpose other than treating gender dysphoria, the clinical diagnosis for the psychological distress experienced by transgender people related to their gender identity.\n“By passing this bill, the House and Senate are forcing thousands of active-duty service members to choose between their careers in the military and the future of their transgender children,” said Mike Zamore, national director of policy &amp; government affairs at the ACLU. “This unconscionable and unjustifiable attack on those families stands in direct contrast to President Joe Biden’s legacy of defending the civil rights of transgender Americans — including when few in his own party showed the courage to do so. President Biden should cement his legacy by vetoing this bill and sending it back to Congress to pass without Speaker Johnson’s last minute health care ban for servicemembers’ kids.”\nIf signed by President Biden, this health care ban would be the first new anti-LGBTQ provision enacted by Congress and signed into law by the president since the enactment of the military’s since-repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy for LGBTQ servicemembers and the since-repealed federal law barring recognition of same-sex marriages known as the Defense of Marriage Act.\nIt is unknown how many transgender youth are currently enrolled in TRICARE or how many of those enrolled are currently receiving coverage for gender-affirming care. In one 2022 analysis, 2,500 minor patients sought care for gender dysphoria through TRICARE Prime insurance at military or civilian treatment facilities in 2017, and 900 received puberty suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a landmark case brought by the ACLU, the ACLU of Tennessee, Lambda Legal, and Akin Gump on behalf of three families and a medical provider challenging a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming hormonal therapies for transgender youth on the grounds the ban violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.            </p>\n                    </div>\n\n\t\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/president-biden-must-veto-defense-bill-attacking-military-families-with-transgender-youth\" aria-label=\"President Biden Must Veto Defense Bill Attacking Military Families with Transgender Youth\">\n    <span>President Biden Must Veto Defense Bill Attacking Military Families with Transgender Youth</span>\n</a></p></div>                </li>\n                            <li>\n                    \n\n<div>\n    \n\n    \n<p><img src=\"https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-links/fallback-press-release.png\" alt=\"Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People's Birth Certificates and Driver's Licenses\">\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>LGBTQ Rights</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <p>\n            <h3>\n                Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People's Birth Certificates and Driver's Licenses            </h3>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n            HELENA, Mont. – A Montana court has granted a preliminary injunction preventing the state of Montana from enforcing policies that bar transgender people from obtaining accurate sex designations on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses.\nAfter a prior restriction on amendments of birth certificates was struck down by the courts, in early 2024 the state of Montana enacted a new rule that categorically bars transgender Montanans from correcting the sex designation on their birth certificates.  Around the same time, the Montana Department of Justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver’s licenses. The plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.\nIn a recent Montana Supreme Court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status – as the state is engaging in here – is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Montana Constitution’s equal protection clause.\nThe plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP.\nPlaintiff Jessica Kalarchik, a veteran who served in the United States Army for 31 years, said: “After finally being able to live my life openly as the woman I know myself to be, I am frustrated that my birth state, Montana, wants me to carry around a birth certificate that incorrectly lists my sex as male. I live my life openly as a woman, I am treated as a woman in my daily life, and there is no reason I should be forced to carry a birth certificate that incorrectly identifies me as male. Fortunately, the court agrees that this ridiculous policy should not be in effect.”\n“Once again the State of Montana chose to adopt a draconian policy that is clearly intended to marginalize transgender Montanans, only for that discriminatory action to be blocked by the courts,” said Akilah Deernose, executive director for the ACLU of Montana. “Here in Montana we treasure our right to privacy and to live our lives free from governmental intrusion. The State of Montana clearly has not learned any lessons from the past few years, where courts have repeatedly struck down unconstitutional laws targeting transgender Montanans.”\n“Forcing anyone to carry documents that contradict their identity unjustly violates their rights to privacy, equal treatment, and not being compelled to convey a government message about their sex that they disagree with,” said Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the ACLU’s LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project. “Such a policy marks transgender people for further mistreatment and discrimination, essentially requiring them to carry papers that out them as transgender any time they need to provide identity documents. Fortunately, the court has refused to allow the state of Montana to subvert the freedom of transgender Montanans to control their own identity as this case goes forward.”\nIn granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the court held, “[i]f the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate the basis of sex.”\nThe state has the option of appealing the district court’s ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, but the underlying case will proceed in district court. A trial has not yet been scheduled.            </p>\n                            <div>\n                            <p><span><b>Court Case:</b> Kalarchik v.

In 2020, lawmakers zeroed in on sports and introduced 20 bills seeking to ban trans people from participating in athletics. These statewide efforts have been supported through a coordinated campaign led by anti-LGBTQ groups that have long worked to attack our communities.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic shut down most state legislatures, Idaho became the first state to pass a sweeping ban on trans people’s participation in athletics from kindergarten through college. We, along with our partners, immediately sued. Advocates across the country are gearing up to continue the fight against these harmful bills in legislatures when they reconvene. In Connecticut, the ACLU is defending the rights of transgender athletes in a lawsuit brought by cisgender athletes seeking to strike down the state’s inclusive policy.\nThough we are fighting every day in the courts and in legislatures, upholding trans rights will take more than judicial and legislative action. It will require rooting out the inaccurate and harmful beliefs underlying these policies. Below, we debunk four myths about trans athletes using the expertise of doctors, academics, and sports psychologists serving as experts in our litigation in Idaho.\n  \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFACT: Including trans athletes will benefit everyone.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMYTH: The participation of trans athletes hurts cis women.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  \n\t  Many who oppose the inclusion of trans athletes erroneously claim that allowing trans athletes to compete will harm cisgender women. This divide and conquer tactic gets it exactly wrong. Excluding women who are trans hurts all women. It invites gender policing that could subject any woman to invasive tests or accusations of being “too masculine” or “too good” at their sport to be a “real” woman. In Idaho, the ACLU represents two young women, one trans and one cis, both of whom are hurt by the law that was passed targeting trans athletes.\nFurther, this myth reinforces stereotypes that women are weak and in need of protection. Politicians have used the “protection” trope time and time again, including in 2016 when they tried banning trans people from public restrooms by creating the debunked “bathroom predator” myth. The real motive is never about protection — it’s about excluding trans people from yet another public space. The arena of sports is no different.\nOn the other hand, including trans athletes will promote values of non-discrimination and inclusion among all student athletes. As longtime coach and sports policy expert Helen Carroll explains, efforts to exclude subsets of girls from sports, “can undermine team unity and also encourage divisiveness by policing who is ‘really’ a girl.” Dr. Mary Fry adds that youth derive the most benefits from athletics when they are exposed to caring environments where teammates are supported by each other and by coaches. Banning some girls from athletics because they are transgender undermines this cohesion and compromises the wide-ranging benefits that youth get from sports.\n  \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFACT: Trans athletes do not have an unfair advantage in sports.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMYTH: Trans athletes’ physiological characteristics provide an unfair advantage over cis athletes.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  \n\t  Women and girls who are trans face discrimination and violence that makes it difficult to even stay in school. According to the U.S. Trans Survey, 22 percent of trans women who were perceived as trans in school were harassed so badly they had to leave school because of it. Another 10 percent were kicked out of school. The idea that women and girls have an advantage because they are trans ignores the actual conditions of their lives.\nTrans athletes vary in athletic ability just like cisgender athletes. “One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,” explains Andraya Yearwood, a student track athlete and ACLU client. “One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster,\" she adds. In Connecticut, where cisgender girl runners have tried to block Andraya from participating in the sport she loves, the very same cis girls who have claimed that trans athletes have an “unfair” advantage have consistently performed as well as or better than transgender competitors.\n\"A person’s genetic make-up and internal and external reproductive anatomy are not useful indicators of athletic performance,”according to Dr. Joshua D. Safer. “For a trans woman athlete who meets NCAA standards, “there is no inherent reason why her physiological characteristics related to athletic performance should be treated differently from the physiological characteristics of a non-transgender woman.”\n  \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFACT: Trans girls are girls.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMYTH: Sex is binary, apparent at birth, and identifiable through singular biological characteristics. \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  \n\t  Girls who are trans are told repeatedly that they are not “real” girls and boys who are trans are told they are not “real” boys. Non-binary people are told that their gender is not real and that they must be either boys or girls. None of these statements are true. Trans people are exactly who we say we are.\nThere is no one way for women’s bodies to be. Women, including women who are transgender, intersex, or disabled, have a range of different physical characteristics.\n“A person’s sex is made up of multiple biological characteristics and they may not all align as typically male or female in a given person,” says Dr. Safer. Further, many people who are not trans can have hormones levels outside of the range considered typical of a cis person of their assigned sex.\nWhen a person does not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, they must be able to transition socially — and that includes participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. According to Dr. Deanna Adkins, excluding trans athletes can be deeply harmful and disruptive to treatment. “I know from experience with my patients that it can be extremely harmful for a transgender young person to be excluded from the team consistent with their gender identity.”\n  \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFACT: Trans people belong on the same teams as other students.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMYTH: Trans students need separate teams.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  \n\t  Trans people have the same right to play sports as anybody else. “For the past nine years,” explains Carroll, “transgender athletes have been able to compete on teams at NCAA member collegiates and universities consistent with their gender identity like all other student-athletes with no disruption to women’s collegiate sports.”\nExcluding trans people from any space or activity is harmful, particularly for trans youth. A trans high school student, for example, may experience detrimental effects to their physical and emotional wellbeing when they are pushed out of affirming spaces and communities. As Lindsay Hecox says, “I just want to run.”According to Dr. Adkins, “When a school or athletic organization denies transgender students the ability to participate equally in athletics because they are transgender, that condones, reinforces, and affirms the transgender students’ social status as outsiders or misfits who deserve the hostility they experience from peers.”\nBelieving and perpetuating myths and misconceptions about trans athletes is harmful. Denying trans people the right to participate is discrimination and it doesn’t just hurt trans people, it hurts all of us.\n  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n                    \n                \n                    Related Content\n                \n            \n                \n                            \n                    \n\n                \n                            \n                    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    LGBTQ Rights\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Florida Judge Allows State Prison Officials to Withhold Medical Care for Transgender Incarcerated People            \n                    \n                    \n            TALLAHASSEE – A federal district court judge has rejected a preliminary injunction request, allowing enforcement of a new Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) policy aimed at withholding gender-affirming medical care to those diagnosed with gender dysphoria and forcing transgender women into their male gender assigned at birth.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Florida Department of Corrections issued a bulletin setting new rules for the medical care that the department would provide to transgender people in its custody who had received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Contrary to the medical mainstream, the bulletin suggests those seeking hormone therapy may have endured “short-termed delusions or beliefs which may later be changed and reversed” and recommended against providing any gender-affirming medical care unless extensive barriers are overcome.\nThat same day, at Florida Department of Corrections facilities across the state, transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria were rounded up and informed that FDC policy had been changed, “up to and including hormone therapy.” They were specifically told that they would no longer have access to clothing and grooming standards that accord with their gender identity and would have 30 days to comply.\nTransgender women were told that those who did not cut their hair in compliance with male grooming standards would be forcibly shorn, and those who did not turn in their female undergarments and feminine canteen items would be disciplined. Transgender women were forced to have their breasts examined to determine if their breasts were large enough, in the eyes of the department, to require a bra.\n“Florida officials are waging a baseless campaign to dehumanize and degrade incarcerated people like our client,” said Li Nowlin-Sohl, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s LGBTQ + HIV Project. “Allowing this policy to move forward threatens the basic human rights of transgender people in the state’s custody and the court’s order today affords the state’s policy more credulity than it deserves when the clear intent of the state is to ban this health care outright.”\nIn October 2024, the ACLU and the ACLU of Florida filed emergency litigation on behalf of Reiyn Keohane – a transgender woman in the custody of the department who has been receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy and clothing and grooming accommodations since 2016 – and a proposed class of transgender inmates with gender dysphoria, on the grounds that the new policy constitutes a violation of their Eighth Amendment right to medically necessary care. The ACLU and ACLU of Florida previously filed a 2016 lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Keohane that led to the now-rescinded policy permitting access to hormone therapy and female clothing and grooming standards for transgender women in FDC custody, which for more than six years permitted hundreds of transgender inmates to access needed gender-affirming care.            \n                            \n                            Court Case: Keohane v.

The American Civil Liberties Union is opposing final passage of the defense bill over the inclusion of this health care ban and calling on President Joe Biden to veto the bill.\nSection 708 of the NDAA would prohibit insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria” such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressant medications, which Speaker Mike Johnson says would “permanently ban transgender medical treatment for minors.” The same treatments would be covered by TRICARE for any medical purpose other than treating gender dysphoria, the clinical diagnosis for the psychological distress experienced by transgender people related to their gender identity.\n“By passing this bill, the House and Senate are forcing thousands of active-duty service members to choose between their careers in the military and the future of their transgender children,” said Mike Zamore, national director of policy & government affairs at the ACLU. “This unconscionable and unjustifiable attack on those families stands in direct contrast to President Joe Biden’s legacy of defending the civil rights of transgender Americans — including when few in his own party showed the courage to do so. President Biden should cement his legacy by vetoing this bill and sending it back to Congress to pass without Speaker Johnson’s last minute health care ban for servicemembers’ kids.”\nIf signed by President Biden, this health care ban would be the first new anti-LGBTQ provision enacted by Congress and signed into law by the president since the enactment of the military’s since-repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy for LGBTQ servicemembers and the since-repealed federal law barring recognition of same-sex marriages known as the Defense of Marriage Act.\nIt is unknown how many transgender youth are currently enrolled in TRICARE or how many of those enrolled are currently receiving coverage for gender-affirming care. In one 2022 analysis, 2,500 minor patients sought care for gender dysphoria through TRICARE Prime insurance at military or civilian treatment facilities in 2017, and 900 received puberty suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a landmark case brought by the ACLU, the ACLU of Tennessee, Lambda Legal, and Akin Gump on behalf of three families and a medical provider challenging a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming hormonal therapies for transgender youth on the grounds the ban violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.            \n                    \n\n\t\n\n    President Biden Must Veto Defense Bill Attacking Military Families with Transgender Youth\n                \n                            \n                    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    LGBTQ Rights\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People's Birth Certificates and Driver's Licenses            \n                    \n                    \n            HELENA, Mont. – A Montana court has granted a preliminary injunction preventing the state of Montana from enforcing policies that bar transgender people from obtaining accurate sex designations on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses.\nAfter a prior restriction on amendments of birth certificates was struck down by the courts, in early 2024 the state of Montana enacted a new rule that categorically bars transgender Montanans from correcting the sex designation on their birth certificates.  Around the same time, the Montana Department of Justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver’s licenses. The plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.\nIn a recent Montana Supreme Court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status – as the state is engaging in here – is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Montana Constitution’s equal protection clause.\nThe plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP.\nPlaintiff Jessica Kalarchik, a veteran who served in the United States Army for 31 years, said: “After finally being able to live my life openly as the woman I know myself to be, I am frustrated that my birth state, Montana, wants me to carry around a birth certificate that incorrectly lists my sex as male. I live my life openly as a woman, I am treated as a woman in my daily life, and there is no reason I should be forced to carry a birth certificate that incorrectly identifies me as male. Fortunately, the court agrees that this ridiculous policy should not be in effect.”\n“Once again the State of Montana chose to adopt a draconian policy that is clearly intended to marginalize transgender Montanans, only for that discriminatory action to be blocked by the courts,” said Akilah Deernose, executive director for the ACLU of Montana. “Here in Montana we treasure our right to privacy and to live our lives free from governmental intrusion. The State of Montana clearly has not learned any lessons from the past few years, where courts have repeatedly struck down unconstitutional laws targeting transgender Montanans.”\n“Forcing anyone to carry documents that contradict their identity unjustly violates their rights to privacy, equal treatment, and not being compelled to convey a government message about their sex that they disagree with,” said Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project. “Such a policy marks transgender people for further mistreatment and discrimination, essentially requiring them to carry papers that out them as transgender any time they need to provide identity documents. Fortunately, the court has refused to allow the state of Montana to subvert the freedom of transgender Montanans to control their own identity as this case goes forward.”\nIn granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the court held, “[i]f the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate the basis of sex.”\nThe state has the option of appealing the district court’s ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, but the underlying case will proceed in district court. A trial has not yet been scheduled.            \n                            \n                            Court Case: Kalarchik v.
