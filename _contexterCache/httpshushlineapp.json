You\n                                can connect using our clearnet address and have confidence you'll remain anonymous.</p>\n                            <p>Or are you sharing national security secrets from within an authoritarian government that\n                                censors their internet and murders journalists? This is not legal advice, but a\n                                reasonable, though possibly prohibitively complex, way to ensure anonymity may be to\n                                somehow acquire and use a Tor-only amnesiac operating system like Tails or Qubes with a\n                                Whonix disposable VM on an uncompromised burner device where you'll encrypt your message\n                                locally before ever connecting the device to the internet. When you connect to the Hush\n                                Line Onion service, it should be on an uncompromised network you do not own, to which\n                                you are not related, and that isn't near your residence. Oh, and don't go anywhere that\n                                uses surveillance cameras or biometric identification, only use cash and don't go to an\n                                ATM near where you'll buy the device, leave your primary cell phone at home, don't check\n                                in to any location requiring your real name or ID, and if you have a car with a GPS in\n                                it, don't drive it. Reasonable, right? This might sound like a lot, but the point is\n                                that there is no one way to use Hush Line or \"perfect\" anonymity. You must consider your\n                                own situation uniquely. No matter what tool you use to send a message, if you share\n                                sensitive enough information about an individual or entity with enough time, money, and\n                                power, operational security will always be critically important.</p>\n                            <p>Sometimes, you can get in trouble by just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, <a\n                                    href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761\"\n                                    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like when this guy was arrested for riding\n                                    his bike past a crime scene and became a suspect</a>.

To safely manage files sent by anonymous people so that a device\n                                or network isn't accidentally compromised, and B.) To provide a censorship-resistant and\n                                anonymous method of sending those files.

SecureDrop is an \"on-prem\" solution, requiring you to store multiple\n                                    servers locally, all focused on isolated tasks, using a dedicated network. Think of\n                                    SecureDrop as a fixed workflow for receiving and handling potentially malicious\n                                    files. You must do all of the things correctly to assume safe operation. It requires\n                                    a lot of time, which means a lot of money.

We simplify our security model by being a text-only\n                                service, meaning there is no possibility of receiving files that could harm your\n                                computer or network.</p>\n                            <p>We're a managed service, so you don't have to worry about maintaining physical\n                                infrastructure or learning new workflows. In fact, to use Hush Line, you don't even have\n                                to log back into the service after setting it up. We can deliver messages directly to\n                                your email inbox, so you can set it, forget it, and never miss a beat. Users can add\n                                their own public PGP key, giving them end-to-end encryption and ensuring messages cannot\n                                be read by anyone but them.</p>\n                            <p>Hush Line is also available on a clearnet address, or through our Onion service. Using\n                                the browser already on your computer or phone, you can easily submit a message without\n                                ever downloading a new app. Users who need higher levels of anonymity may optionally use\n                                our Onion service, requiring them to download Tor Browser. This flexibility allows for\n                                our service to be used for benign use cases or elevated threat levels.</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3><button type=\"button\" class=\"faq-question\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq7\"><img\n                                    class=\"arrow\" src=\"assets/img/icon-chevron.png\" alt=\"chevron arrow\"> Why\n                                not fork SecureDrop's code?</button></h3>\n                        <div class=\"faq-answer\" id=\"faq7\" hidden>\n                            <p>While open-source, forking SecureDrop would require significant rework.

To safely manage files sent by anonymous people so that a device\n                                or network isn't accidentally compromised, and B.) To provide a censorship-resistant and\n                                anonymous method of sending those files. When someone submits a message, an account is\n                                created for them, allowing two-way communication.

SecureDrop is an \"on-prem\" solution, requiring you to store multiple\n                                    servers locally, all focused on isolated tasks, using a dedicated network. Think of\n                                    SecureDrop as a fixed workflow for receiving and handling potentially malicious\n                                    files. You must do all of the things correctly to assume safe operation. It requires\n                                    a lot of time, which means a lot of money. The installation and setup of the system,\n                                    in most cases, needs to be conducted by a member of the SD team, with service\n                                    contracts helping to ensure proper maintenance of the infrastructure.</li>\n                            </ol>\n                            <p>The message submitter must:</p>\n                            <ol>\n                                <li>Learn how to use SecureDrop.</li>\n                                <li>Download Tor Browser.</li>\n                                <li>Find the correct Onion address for their recipient.</li>\n                                <li>Submit a message.</li>\n                                <li>Save their account credentials.</li>\n                                <li>Check back for progress.</li>\n                            </ol>\n                            <p>Hush Line is not a replacement for SecureDrop. Instead, it's for organizations who might\n                                not have the staff required to manage such a system or need nation-state levels of\n                                defense for all of their anonymous tips. We simplify our security model by being a text-only\n                                service, meaning there is no possibility of receiving files that could harm your\n                                computer or network.</p>\n                            <p>We're a managed service, so you don't have to worry about maintaining physical\n                                infrastructure or learning new workflows. In fact, to use Hush Line, you don't even have\n                                to log back into the service after setting it up. We can deliver messages directly to\n                                your email inbox, so you can set it, forget it, and never miss a beat. Users can add\n                                their own public PGP key, giving them end-to-end encryption and ensuring messages cannot\n                                be read by anyone but them.</p>\n                            <p>Hush Line is also available on a clearnet address, or through our Onion service. Using\n                                the browser already on your computer or phone, you can easily submit a message without\n                                ever downloading a new app. Users who need higher levels of anonymity may optionally use\n                                our Onion service, requiring them to download Tor Browser. This flexibility allows for\n                                our service to be used for benign use cases or elevated threat levels.</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <h3></h3>\n                        \n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        <section id=\"pricing\">\n            <h2>Affordable &amp; Ethical Pricing</h2>\n            <p>If you need more than what our free tier provides, we have options to meet your requirements!

To safely manage files sent by anonymous people so that a device\n                                or network isn't accidentally compromised, and B.) To provide a censorship-resistant and\n                                anonymous method of sending those files. When someone submits a message, an account is\n                                created for them, allowing two-way communication. To use SecureDrop:\n                            The tip line owner must:\n                            \n                                Do A LOT. SecureDrop is an \"on-prem\" solution, requiring you to store multiple\n                                    servers locally, all focused on isolated tasks, using a dedicated network. Think of\n                                    SecureDrop as a fixed workflow for receiving and handling potentially malicious\n                                    files. You must do all of the things correctly to assume safe operation. It requires\n                                    a lot of time, which means a lot of money. The installation and setup of the system,\n                                    in most cases, needs to be conducted by a member of the SD team, with service\n                                    contracts helping to ensure proper maintenance of the infrastructure.\n                            \n                            The message submitter must:\n                            \n                                Learn how to use SecureDrop.\n                                Download Tor Browser.\n                                Find the correct Onion address for their recipient.\n                                Submit a message.\n                                Save their account credentials.\n                                Check back for progress.\n                            \n                            Hush Line is not a replacement for SecureDrop. Instead, it's for organizations who might\n                                not have the staff required to manage such a system or need nation-state levels of\n                                defense for all of their anonymous tips. We simplify our security model by being a text-only\n                                service, meaning there is no possibility of receiving files that could harm your\n                                computer or network.\n                            We're a managed service, so you don't have to worry about maintaining physical\n                                infrastructure or learning new workflows. In fact, to use Hush Line, you don't even have\n                                to log back into the service after setting it up. We can deliver messages directly to\n                                your email inbox, so you can set it, forget it, and never miss a beat. Users can add\n                                their own public PGP key, giving them end-to-end encryption and ensuring messages cannot\n                                be read by anyone but them.\n                            Hush Line is also available on a clearnet address, or through our Onion service. Using\n                                the browser already on your computer or phone, you can easily submit a message without\n                                ever downloading a new app. Users who need higher levels of anonymity may optionally use\n                                our Onion service, requiring them to download Tor Browser. This flexibility allows for\n                                our service to be used for benign use cases or elevated threat levels.\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n            Affordable & Ethical Pricing\n            If you need more than what our free tier provides, we have options to meet your requirements!
