underwhelming these days. Google is great at answering questions with an objective answer, like “# of billionaires in the world” or “What is the population of Iceland?” It’s pretty bad at answering questions that require judgment and context like “What do NFT collectors think about NFTs?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evidence is everywhere. These days, I find myself suppressing the garbage Internet by searching on Google for “Substack + future of learning” to find the best takes on education. We hack Twitter with the “</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1435299942235615236\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what is the best</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” posts over and over again. When I’m researching a new product, I type &#8220;X item reddit&#8221; into Google. I find enormous value in small, niche, often forgotten sites like </span><a href=\"https://spaghetti.directory/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spaghetti Directory</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an emergence of tools like Notion, Airtable, and Readwise where people are aggregating content and resources, reviving the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">curated web</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But at the moment these are mostly solo affairs — hidden in private or semi-private corners of the Internet, fragmented, poorly indexed, and unavailable for public use. We haven&#8217;t figured out how to make them multiplayer. In cases where we’ve made them public and collaborative — here is</span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IDgIyPcfwJGG-zmXeMAenYbePQVHkc2P6WCwKEZgpk/htmlview#gid=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a great example</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — these projects are often short-lived and poorly maintained.</span></p>\n<p>The stated mission of a company worth almost two trillion dollars is to “organize the world’s information” and yet the Internet remains poorly organized. Or, stated differently, in a world of infinite information,<b> it’s no longer enough to organize the world’s information. It becomes important to organize the world’s </b><b><i>trustworthy</i></b><b> information.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did we get here?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to believe, but one of Google’s main problems, once it got going, was that there just wasn’t much to see online. Having a great search engine is useless if somebody types in “how to grow an herb garden” and the answer doesn’t exist online. With the advent of Google AdWords, it became profitable to put out low-quality content that passed as informative and filled Google’s search engine results. The end result is that the websites at the top of Google are not necessarily the highest-quality ones, but rather the ones that put the most effort into SEO. What started as a well-intentioned way to organize the world’s information has turned into a business focusing most of its resources on monetizing clicks to support advertisers, rather than focusing on delivering trusted search results for people.</span></p>\n<p>The problem, now so drastically different from a decade ago, is not <i>what</i> to read/buy/eat/watch/etc., but<b> figuring out the </b><b><i>best thing</i></b><b> to read/buy/eat/watch/etc. with my limited time and attention.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audacious teams, like </span><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DuckDuckGo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://neeva.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neeva</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are trying to compete with Google head-on by building massive horizontal search engines. Rather than crawling and indexing things their own way, they sit on top of existing data sources and position themselves as privacy-focused alternatives to Google. But protection of privacy is not a compelling enough reason to leave Google. For the vast majority of people, allowing them to “control their own data” is not a selling point, especially if it requires paying for something they’re used to getting for free.</span></p>\n<p>I believe the opportunity in search is not to attack Google head-on with a massive, one-size-fits-all horizontal aggregator, but instead to<b> build boutique search engines that index, curate, and organize things in new ways.</b></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5732\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"990\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram.jpg 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-300x149.jpg 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1024x507.jpg 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-768x380.jpg 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1536x760.jpg 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1300x644.jpg 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1440x713.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vertical search aggregators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google is a great example of how the internet enabled scale and speed: every page on the web returned in an instant. But, increasingly, we’re seeing that this scale is at odds with a fundamental human need: </span><b>relevance</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Someone who wants to find the best freelance designer, or the best sushi restaurant, or the best NFT to buy will not find the answer on Google.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no search architecture that will work universally across all categories. It’s hard to imagine wanting to use the same UX to search for recipes as to search for freelancers. Whereas Google’s product begins and ends with a search bar, trading off functionality for simplicity, vertical search players like Yelp, Expedia, Zillow, and Behance emerged to fill functionality and relevancy gaps using structured data specific to their industries. With strong opinions on how to organize information, reflected in their choice of filters, vertical search aggregators have distinct advantages that horizontal software can never achieve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here, too, relevance depends on the sociology of the current moment. For example, on</span><a href=\"https://www.behance.net/search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Behance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the online creative community, school and location are featured prominently as filters — implying that where you live and where you went to school is an important indicator of the quality of your design portfolio. In a world where talent is being decoupled from credentialism and geography, those filters are losing relevance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As signals evolve, new ways of indexing and surface areas for innovation emerge. If Behance were designed today, I’d argue neither “location” nor “school” would be filters.</span></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5733\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search.png 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-300x147.png 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1024x503.png 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-768x377.png 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1536x754.png 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1300x638.png 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1440x707.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Yelp, a search for “electricians in Miami&#8221; begins with a page titled “The Best 10 Electricians in Miami, FL” with text underneath that indicates the majority of these are sponsored results. </span></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5738\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1515\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search.png 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-300x227.png 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1024x776.png 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-768x582.png 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1536x1164.png 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1300x985.png 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1440x1091.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>When you monetize via ads, curation takes a backseat to featuring advertisers</strong> because there is just less digital real estate available to curate your own recommendations.

A combination of irrelevant filters, ad-based business models, and unconstrained supply has overwhelmed consumers and made it hard to find signals in these platforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vertical search aggregators work when you know exactly what you want. But knowing what you want isn’t usually the starting point, which creates an </span><b>opportunity to help the overwhelmed consumer</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with better discovery and curation along the funnel.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curators, curators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has become popular to say we live in the information age, and we need “curation” to help us sort through the mess. But thus far, </span><b>the conversation around curation has been too focused on the content and not enough on the structure</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We seem to have accepted the job of the curator as providing a product review, a list of links, or a song recommendation — all inside linear structures and chronological feeds designed to surface the ideas of the last 24 hours, not to accumulate and surface knowledge as needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A daily email with the top five Alibaba products feels fun and gimmicky as a side project, but it doesn’t help when you’re trying to find the best crib for your baby. Inevitably, you’ll want a way to search through a curator’s archives.</span></p>\n<p>Curation, when thought of in the context of sharing bite-sized, isolated bits in feed-like architectures, is predominantly about <em>entertainment</em>, not <em>utility</em>. It’s not wrong to say there is a market for this kind of curation. What people miss, though, is that this market is already captured by Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These entertainment giants offer curation that demands our attention, but they don’t offer curation on demand. </span><b>The opportunity is in moving curated content feeds away from their never-ending-now orientation and toward more goal-oriented interfaces.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> People should be able to find whatever content they want on their terms and not be beholden to when the curator decides to publish.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boutique search engines are next-level curation</span></h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All curation grows until it requires search, and all search grows until it requires curation. </span></i></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—Ben Evans</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying Ben Evans’ framework, it becomes clear that while the vertical search players have become too large and need curation, the curation feeds have become too long to browse and require search and structured data.

Because searchable interfaces are densely linked, an explorer can follow multiple trails through the content, rather than being dumped into a &#8220;most recent&#8221; feed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a tight relationship between curation and search, the real question is not <em>whether</em> you need curation or search but <em>at what point</em> it comes in, and <em>how</em>:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotify doesn’t curate what songs make it to their platform.

At that point, vertical search aggregators like Yelp offer more utility. Yahoo, for example, became too big to be browsed, lost its signaling power, and reached the point where Google was better. The line between curator, compiler, and cataloguer is thin and there is a natural </span><a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invisible asymptote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — <strong>diminishing returns on more data over time. </strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the business model for this new wave of search engines? </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, vertical search engines are simple — content is the supply, and eyeballs are the demand. But the last wave of vertical search engines was built atop ad-based business models, which made things trickier. In an ad-driven marketplace, the eyeballs are on the supply side. Their attention is what the demand side — advertisers — want. The downside to this ad-driven model is that advertisers and content producers are competing for the same attention, which is why these sites end up feeling like marketing blogs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why subscriptions present an opportunity. Subscription simplifies the network effects to two sides: content as supply, a paying audience as demand. But subscription itself is not a panacea, especially when the use cases are not frequent enough. How often are you needing to find a freelancer? An investor? If use cases are not frequent enough, the utility of a search engine won’t translate to a sustainable business model and you’ll have to come up with your own flavor of “come for the search, stay for something else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, as my friend Joey points out in </span><a href=\"https://ff.mirror.xyz/Rf3fOSJmT4mD1AobLmZ0wM6lmea5gEUDqfcW91Iv6XI\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, any product where you’re spending a lot of time using it in incognito mode has a pretty big UX problem. How many </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accounts did you create before finally giving in to the paywall? With today’s subscription models, customers have no real incentive to help the platform grow. </span><b>Nascent token-based business models show early signs of promise.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> By giving ownership to stakeholders and allowing subscribers to benefit from future upside, startups can overcome the cold start problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though appealing, a playbook for tokenized business models has not yet emerged. I suspect this will change in the coming years, and I’m excited to improve my understanding of the subject.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who curates the curators? </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Platforms like Twitter delegate this responsibility to their users, who have to go through a long and arduous process of following a huge number of people to ultimately arrive at a self-curated timeline that mimics their interests. Some centralize their curation — at OnDeck, you trust that they are doing the work of selecting who can join their network. Yet others stay away from curation in favor of more traditional crowdsourcing. The spectrum is wide. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you find the search engine in the first place? </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started this piece arguing that Google needs to be unbundled. That’s a catchy headline but, in truth, I believe that until you can build habitual recall into your product, Google will be an important part of how your engine gets discovered in the first place. Zillow and Airbnb are examples of search companies that enjoy a good amount of direct traffic, but SEO was a big part of their early strategy. By being among the first to create the definitive page for a home, they benefited from an SEO land grab that has been hard to displace since.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are far from achieving the grand vision of the Internet. The project of human knowledge, as it stands today, is a vast ocean of ephemeral and fragmented information and ideas, with the best sources near-impossible to find. <strong>We need more interfaces with a point of view on what information is missing, how it needs to be organized, and at what point of the value chain the curation has to happen.</strong></span></p>\n                            <div class=\"content-area-end\"></div>\r\n                            <div class=\"article-footer\">\r\n                                Posted <time>May 2, 2022</time>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                    <ul class=\"author-list\">\r\n                                                                                    <li>\r\n                                                <div class=\"avatar\">\r\n                                                                                                            <a href=\"https://future.com/author/sari-azout/\">\r\n                                                    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                    <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-22-at-10.59.33-AM-150x150.png\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"Sari Azout\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                                            </a>\r\n                                                                                                    </div>\r\n                                                <div class=\"flex\">\r\n                                                    <div class=\"description\">\r\n                                                                                                                    <a href=\"https://future.com/author/sari-azout/\">\r\n                                                                                                                <p>\r\n                                                            <strong>Sari Azout</strong> is a founder of startupy.world, a search engine for tech and culture insights.

Google is great at answering questions with an objective answer, like “# of billionaires in the world” or “What is the population of Iceland?” It’s pretty bad at answering questions that require judgment and context like “What do NFT collectors think about NFTs?”</span></p>\n<p><span>The evidence is everywhere. These days, I find myself suppressing the garbage Internet by searching on Google for “Substack + future of learning” to find the best takes on education. We hack Twitter with the “</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1435299942235615236\"><span>what is the best</span></a><span>” posts over and over again. When I’m researching a new product, I type “X item reddit” into Google. I find enormous value in small, niche, often forgotten sites like </span><a href=\"https://spaghetti.directory/\"><span>Spaghetti Directory</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s an emergence of tools like Notion, Airtable, and Readwise where people are aggregating content and resources, reviving the </span><i><span>curated web</span></i><span>. But at the moment these are mostly solo affairs — hidden in private or semi-private corners of the Internet, fragmented, poorly indexed, and unavailable for public use. We haven’t figured out how to make them multiplayer. In cases where we’ve made them public and collaborative — here is</span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IDgIyPcfwJGG-zmXeMAenYbePQVHkc2P6WCwKEZgpk/htmlview#gid=0\"><span> a great example</span></a><span> — these projects are often short-lived and poorly maintained.</span></p>\n<p>The stated mission of a company worth almost two trillion dollars is to “organize the world’s information” and yet the Internet remains poorly organized. Or, stated differently, in a world of infinite information,<b> it’s no longer enough to organize the world’s information. It becomes important to organize the world’s </b><b><i>trustworthy</i></b><b> information.</b></p>\n<p><span>How did we get here?</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s hard to believe, but one of Google’s main problems, once it got going, was that there just wasn’t much to see online. Having a great search engine is useless if somebody types in “how to grow an herb garden” and the answer doesn’t exist online. With the advent of Google AdWords, it became profitable to put out low-quality content that passed as informative and filled Google’s search engine results. The end result is that the websites at the top of Google are not necessarily the highest-quality ones, but rather the ones that put the most effort into SEO. What started as a well-intentioned way to organize the world’s information has turned into a business focusing most of its resources on monetizing clicks to support advertisers, rather than focusing on delivering trusted search results for people.</span></p>\n<p>The problem, now so drastically different from a decade ago, is not <i>what</i> to read/buy/eat/watch/etc., but<b> figuring out the </b><b><i>best thing</i></b><b> to read/buy/eat/watch/etc. with my limited time and attention.</b></p>\n<p><span>Audacious teams, like </span><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\"><span>DuckDuckGo</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://neeva.com/\"><span>Neeva</span></a><span>, are trying to compete with Google head-on by building massive horizontal search engines. Rather than crawling and indexing things their own way, they sit on top of existing data sources and position themselves as privacy-focused alternatives to Google. But protection of privacy is not a compelling enough reason to leave Google. For the vast majority of people, allowing them to “control their own data” is not a selling point, especially if it requires paying for something they’re used to getting for free.</span></p>\n<p>I believe the opportunity in search is not to attack Google head-on with a massive, one-size-fits-all horizontal aggregator, but instead to<b> build boutique search engines that index, curate, and organize things in new ways.</b></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"990\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram.jpg 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-300x149.jpg 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1024x507.jpg 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-768x380.jpg 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1536x760.jpg 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1300x644.jpg 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Venn-Diagram-1440x713.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></figure>\n<h2><span>Vertical search aggregators</span></h2>\n<p><span>Google is a great example of how the internet enabled scale and speed: every page on the web returned in an instant. But, increasingly, we’re seeing that this scale is at odds with a fundamental human need: </span><b>relevance</b><span>. Someone who wants to find the best freelance designer, or the best sushi restaurant, or the best NFT to buy will not find the answer on Google.</span></p>\n<p><span>There is no search architecture that will work universally across all categories. It’s hard to imagine wanting to use the same UX to search for recipes as to search for freelancers. Whereas Google’s product begins and ends with a search bar, trading off functionality for simplicity, vertical search players like Yelp, Expedia, Zillow, and Behance emerged to fill functionality and relevancy gaps using structured data specific to their industries. With strong opinions on how to organize information, reflected in their choice of filters, vertical search aggregators have distinct advantages that horizontal software can never achieve.</span></p>\n<p><span>But here, too, relevance depends on the sociology of the current moment. For example, on</span><a href=\"https://www.behance.net/search\"><span> Behance</span></a><span>, the online creative community, school and location are featured prominently as filters — implying that where you live and where you went to school is an important indicator of the quality of your design portfolio. In a world where talent is being decoupled from credentialism and geography, those filters are losing relevance.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>As signals evolve, new ways of indexing and surface areas for innovation emerge. If Behance were designed today, I’d argue neither “location” nor “school” would be filters.</span></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search.png 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-300x147.png 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1024x503.png 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-768x377.png 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1536x754.png 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1300x638.png 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-Behance-Search-1440x707.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></figure>\n<p><span>On Yelp, a search for “electricians in Miami” begins with a page titled “The Best 10 Electricians in Miami, FL” with text underneath that indicates the majority of these are sponsored results.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1515\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search.png 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-300x227.png 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1024x776.png 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-768x582.png 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1536x1164.png 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1300x985.png 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boutique-Search-Yelp-Search-1440x1091.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></figure>\n<p><span><strong>When you monetize via ads, curation takes a backseat to featuring advertisers</strong> because there is just less digital real estate available to curate your own recommendations. So these platforms end up making ethically dubious design choices that generate massive </span><a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2019/05/trusted-brands/\"><span>trust gaps</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, across vertical search aggregators like Yelp, Zillow, LinkedIn, and Behance, anyone can have a profile. A combination of irrelevant filters, ad-based business models, and unconstrained supply has overwhelmed consumers and made it hard to find signals in these platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Vertical search aggregators work when you know exactly what you want. But knowing what you want isn’t usually the starting point, which creates an </span><b>opportunity to help the overwhelmed consumer</b><span> with better discovery and curation along the funnel.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Curators, curators</span></h2>\n<p><span>It has become popular to say we live in the information age, and we need “curation” to help us sort through the mess. But thus far, </span><b>the conversation around curation has been too focused on the content and not enough on the structure</b><span>. We seem to have accepted the job of the curator as providing a product review, a list of links, or a song recommendation — all inside linear structures and chronological feeds designed to surface the ideas of the last 24 hours, not to accumulate and surface knowledge as needed.</span></p>\n<p><span>A daily email with the top five Alibaba products feels fun and gimmicky as a side project, but it doesn’t help when you’re trying to find the best crib for your baby. Inevitably, you’ll want a way to search through a curator’s archives.</span></p>\n<p>Curation, when thought of in the context of sharing bite-sized, isolated bits in feed-like architectures, is predominantly about <em>entertainment</em>, not <em>utility</em>. It’s not wrong to say there is a market for this kind of curation. What people miss, though, is that this market is already captured by Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok.</p>\n<p><span>These entertainment giants offer curation that demands our attention, but they don’t offer curation on demand. </span><b>The opportunity is in moving curated content feeds away from their never-ending-now orientation and toward more goal-oriented interfaces.</b><span> People should be able to find whatever content they want on their terms and not be beholden to when the curator decides to publish.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Boutique search engines are next-level curation</span></h2>\n<p><i><span>All curation grows until it requires search, and all search grows until it requires curation. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>—Ben Evans</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Applying Ben Evans’ framework, it becomes clear that while the vertical search players have become too large and need curation, the curation feeds have become too long to browse and require search and structured data. The solution is better search and better curation, all wrapped in a better business model — a combination I call </span><b>boutique search engines</b><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Searchable, curated interfaces will help us move away from ephemeral, time-bound feeds into contextual, high-signal, trustworthy knowledge spaces. Because searchable interfaces are densely linked, an explorer can follow multiple trails through the content, rather than being dumped into a “most recent” feed.</span></p>\n<p><span>With such a tight relationship between curation and search, the real question is not <em>whether</em> you need curation or search but <em>at what point</em> it comes in, and <em>how</em>:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>Spotify doesn’t curate what songs make it to their platform. Instead, it takes the entire universe of music and finds endless ways to discover and search across its library, including a mix of manual curation (via playlists curated by its in-house team of curators and its users) and algorithms (like Discover Weekly).</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>Wirecutter does not review every product. It manually curates the top products, and then uses search and other discovery tools to help you find what you need.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://thingtesting.com/\"><span>Thingtesting</span></a><span> is not automatically scraping all Consumer Packaged Goods brands on the Internet. Someone from its team or community went out of their way to add a brand to the database.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>If you’re searching the </span><a href=\"https://beondeck.com/\"><span>On Deck</span></a><span> member database, you know everyone has applied, been vetted, and paid a fee to participate in the program.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>If you’re reading through transcripts on </span><a href=\"https://www.tegus.co/\"><span>Tegus</span></a><span>, you know the content comes from experts that have been handpicked by its team.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Across all these examples, the value is in </span><i><span>what they exclude</span></i><span> as much as </span><i><span>what they include</span></i><span>. The friction in the supply side is what generates the signal.</span></p>\n<p><span>On top of the signals, these businesses have built strong search engines. OnDeck, for instance, has built an opinionated graph that allows you to discover talent in unique ways. For example, you can filter by people with “software engineering” skills whose current status is “open to new ideas.” As a founder looking for engineering talent, I’ll take this curated dataset over LinkedIn’s any day.</span></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1284\" srcset=\"https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search.png 2000w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search-300x193.png 300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search-1024x657.png 1024w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search-768x493.png 768w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search-1536x986.png 1536w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search-1300x835.png 1300w, https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Boutique-Search-LinkedIn-Search-1440x924.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></figure>\n<p>Unlike vertical search aggregators, <b>boutique search engines feel less like the Yellow Pages and more like texting your friends to ask for a recommendation.</b><span> They have constrained supply, which is the foundation for their biggest moat: </span><b>trust</b><span>.

Getting the right mix of curation, search, algorithms, and business model will likely prove massively difficult and massively valuable. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of questions we’re pondering as we build <a href=\"https://beta.startupy.world/\">Startupy</a>, our attempt at a boutique search engine for qualitative insights.</span></p>\n<h3><span>If the value proposition is signal over noise, how do you scale the signal?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span>Over and over again, curation sites fall into an existential trap. They start with high-quality, curated recommendations. As they grow, they scale with crowdsourcing, often filling the gap with scraping. Over time, the content goes from great to good. At that point, vertical search aggregators like Yelp offer more utility. Yahoo, for example, became too big to be browsed, lost its signaling power, and reached the point where Google was better. The line between curator, compiler, and cataloguer is thin and there is a natural </span><a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes\"><span>invisible asymptote</span></a><span> — <strong>diminishing returns on more data over time.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span>What is the business model for this new wave of search engines?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span>On the surface, vertical search engines are simple — content is the supply, and eyeballs are the demand. But the last wave of vertical search engines was built atop ad-based business models, which made things trickier. In an ad-driven marketplace, the eyeballs are on the supply side. Their attention is what the demand side — advertisers — want. The downside to this ad-driven model is that advertisers and content producers are competing for the same attention, which is why these sites end up feeling like marketing blogs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>This is why subscriptions present an opportunity. Subscription simplifies the network effects to two sides: content as supply, a paying audience as demand. But subscription itself is not a panacea, especially when the use cases are not frequent enough. How often are you needing to find a freelancer? An investor? If use cases are not frequent enough, the utility of a search engine won’t translate to a sustainable business model and you’ll have to come up with your own flavor of “come for the search, stay for something else.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Moreover, as my friend Joey points out in </span><a href=\"https://ff.mirror.xyz/Rf3fOSJmT4mD1AobLmZ0wM6lmea5gEUDqfcW91Iv6XI\"><span>this article</span></a><span>, any product where you’re spending a lot of time using it in incognito mode has a pretty big UX problem.

Google is great at answering questions with an objective answer, like “# of billionaires in the world” or “What is the population of Iceland?” It’s pretty bad at answering questions that require judgment and context like “What do NFT collectors think about NFTs?”\nThe evidence is everywhere. These days, I find myself suppressing the garbage Internet by searching on Google for “Substack + future of learning” to find the best takes on education. We hack Twitter with the “what is the best” posts over and over again. When I’m researching a new product, I type “X item reddit” into Google. I find enormous value in small, niche, often forgotten sites like Spaghetti Directory.\nThere’s an emergence of tools like Notion, Airtable, and Readwise where people are aggregating content and resources, reviving the curated web. But at the moment these are mostly solo affairs — hidden in private or semi-private corners of the Internet, fragmented, poorly indexed, and unavailable for public use. We haven’t figured out how to make them multiplayer. In cases where we’ve made them public and collaborative — here is a great example — these projects are often short-lived and poorly maintained.\nThe stated mission of a company worth almost two trillion dollars is to “organize the world’s information” and yet the Internet remains poorly organized. Or, stated differently, in a world of infinite information, it’s no longer enough to organize the world’s information. It becomes important to organize the world’s trustworthy information.\nHow did we get here?\nIt’s hard to believe, but one of Google’s main problems, once it got going, was that there just wasn’t much to see online. Having a great search engine is useless if somebody types in “how to grow an herb garden” and the answer doesn’t exist online. With the advent of Google AdWords, it became profitable to put out low-quality content that passed as informative and filled Google’s search engine results. The end result is that the websites at the top of Google are not necessarily the highest-quality ones, but rather the ones that put the most effort into SEO. What started as a well-intentioned way to organize the world’s information has turned into a business focusing most of its resources on monetizing clicks to support advertisers, rather than focusing on delivering trusted search results for people.\nThe problem, now so drastically different from a decade ago, is not what to read/buy/eat/watch/etc., but figuring out the best thing to read/buy/eat/watch/etc. with my limited time and attention.\nAudacious teams, like DuckDuckGo and Neeva, are trying to compete with Google head-on by building massive horizontal search engines. Rather than crawling and indexing things their own way, they sit on top of existing data sources and position themselves as privacy-focused alternatives to Google. But protection of privacy is not a compelling enough reason to leave Google. For the vast majority of people, allowing them to “control their own data” is not a selling point, especially if it requires paying for something they’re used to getting for free.\nI believe the opportunity in search is not to attack Google head-on with a massive, one-size-fits-all horizontal aggregator, but instead to build boutique search engines that index, curate, and organize things in new ways.\n\nVertical search aggregators\nGoogle is a great example of how the internet enabled scale and speed: every page on the web returned in an instant. But, increasingly, we’re seeing that this scale is at odds with a fundamental human need: relevance. Someone who wants to find the best freelance designer, or the best sushi restaurant, or the best NFT to buy will not find the answer on Google.\nThere is no search architecture that will work universally across all categories. It’s hard to imagine wanting to use the same UX to search for recipes as to search for freelancers. Whereas Google’s product begins and ends with a search bar, trading off functionality for simplicity, vertical search players like Yelp, Expedia, Zillow, and Behance emerged to fill functionality and relevancy gaps using structured data specific to their industries. With strong opinions on how to organize information, reflected in their choice of filters, vertical search aggregators have distinct advantages that horizontal software can never achieve.\nBut here, too, relevance depends on the sociology of the current moment. For example, on Behance, the online creative community, school and location are featured prominently as filters — implying that where you live and where you went to school is an important indicator of the quality of your design portfolio. In a world where talent is being decoupled from credentialism and geography, those filters are losing relevance. \nAs signals evolve, new ways of indexing and surface areas for innovation emerge. If Behance were designed today, I’d argue neither “location” nor “school” would be filters.\n\nOn Yelp, a search for “electricians in Miami” begins with a page titled “The Best 10 Electricians in Miami, FL” with text underneath that indicates the majority of these are sponsored results. \n\nWhen you monetize via ads, curation takes a backseat to featuring advertisers because there is just less digital real estate available to curate your own recommendations. So these platforms end up making ethically dubious design choices that generate massive trust gaps.\nAdditionally, across vertical search aggregators like Yelp, Zillow, LinkedIn, and Behance, anyone can have a profile. A combination of irrelevant filters, ad-based business models, and unconstrained supply has overwhelmed consumers and made it hard to find signals in these platforms. \nVertical search aggregators work when you know exactly what you want. But knowing what you want isn’t usually the starting point, which creates an opportunity to help the overwhelmed consumer with better discovery and curation along the funnel.\nCurators, curators\nIt has become popular to say we live in the information age, and we need “curation” to help us sort through the mess. But thus far, the conversation around curation has been too focused on the content and not enough on the structure. We seem to have accepted the job of the curator as providing a product review, a list of links, or a song recommendation — all inside linear structures and chronological feeds designed to surface the ideas of the last 24 hours, not to accumulate and surface knowledge as needed.\nA daily email with the top five Alibaba products feels fun and gimmicky as a side project, but it doesn’t help when you’re trying to find the best crib for your baby. Inevitably, you’ll want a way to search through a curator’s archives.\nCuration, when thought of in the context of sharing bite-sized, isolated bits in feed-like architectures, is predominantly about entertainment, not utility. It’s not wrong to say there is a market for this kind of curation. What people miss, though, is that this market is already captured by Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok.\nThese entertainment giants offer curation that demands our attention, but they don’t offer curation on demand. The opportunity is in moving curated content feeds away from their never-ending-now orientation and toward more goal-oriented interfaces. People should be able to find whatever content they want on their terms and not be beholden to when the curator decides to publish.\nBoutique search engines are next-level curation\nAll curation grows until it requires search, and all search grows until it requires curation. \n—Ben Evans\nApplying Ben Evans’ framework, it becomes clear that while the vertical search players have become too large and need curation, the curation feeds have become too long to browse and require search and structured data. The solution is better search and better curation, all wrapped in a better business model — a combination I call boutique search engines.\nSearchable, curated interfaces will help us move away from ephemeral, time-bound feeds into contextual, high-signal, trustworthy knowledge spaces. Because searchable interfaces are densely linked, an explorer can follow multiple trails through the content, rather than being dumped into a “most recent” feed.\nWith such a tight relationship between curation and search, the real question is not whether you need curation or search but at what point it comes in, and how:\n\nSpotify doesn’t curate what songs make it to their platform. Instead, it takes the entire universe of music and finds endless ways to discover and search across its library, including a mix of manual curation (via playlists curated by its in-house team of curators and its users) and algorithms (like Discover Weekly).\nWirecutter does not review every product. It manually curates the top products, and then uses search and other discovery tools to help you find what you need.\nThingtesting is not automatically scraping all Consumer Packaged Goods brands on the Internet. Someone from its team or community went out of their way to add a brand to the database.\nIf you’re searching the On Deck member database, you know everyone has applied, been vetted, and paid a fee to participate in the program.\nIf you’re reading through transcripts on Tegus, you know the content comes from experts that have been handpicked by its team.\n\nAcross all these examples, the value is in what they exclude as much as what they include. The friction in the supply side is what generates the signal.\nOn top of the signals, these businesses have built strong search engines. OnDeck, for instance, has built an opinionated graph that allows you to discover talent in unique ways. For example, you can filter by people with “software engineering” skills whose current status is “open to new ideas.” As a founder looking for engineering talent, I’ll take this curated dataset over LinkedIn’s any day.\n\nUnlike vertical search aggregators, boutique search engines feel less like the Yellow Pages and more like texting your friends to ask for a recommendation. They have constrained supply, which is the foundation for their biggest moat: trust. Importantly, boutique search engines also introduce new business models that don’t rely on advertising.\n\nQuestions remain, because search is hard \nBuilding boutique search engines requires countless nuanced product choices. Getting the right mix of curation, search, algorithms, and business model will likely prove massively difficult and massively valuable. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of questions we’re pondering as we build Startupy, our attempt at a boutique search engine for qualitative insights.\nIf the value proposition is signal over noise, how do you scale the signal? \nOver and over again, curation sites fall into an existential trap. They start with high-quality, curated recommendations. As they grow, they scale with crowdsourcing, often filling the gap with scraping. Over time, the content goes from great to good. At that point, vertical search aggregators like Yelp offer more utility. Yahoo, for example, became too big to be browsed, lost its signaling power, and reached the point where Google was better. The line between curator, compiler, and cataloguer is thin and there is a natural invisible asymptote — diminishing returns on more data over time. \nWhat is the business model for this new wave of search engines? \nOn the surface, vertical search engines are simple — content is the supply, and eyeballs are the demand. But the last wave of vertical search engines was built atop ad-based business models, which made things trickier. In an ad-driven marketplace, the eyeballs are on the supply side. Their attention is what the demand side — advertisers — want. The downside to this ad-driven model is that advertisers and content producers are competing for the same attention, which is why these sites end up feeling like marketing blogs. \nThis is why subscriptions present an opportunity. Subscription simplifies the network effects to two sides: content as supply, a paying audience as demand. But subscription itself is not a panacea, especially when the use cases are not frequent enough. How often are you needing to find a freelancer? An investor? If use cases are not frequent enough, the utility of a search engine won’t translate to a sustainable business model and you’ll have to come up with your own flavor of “come for the search, stay for something else.”\nMoreover, as my friend Joey points out in this article, any product where you’re spending a lot of time using it in incognito mode has a pretty big UX problem. How many New York Times accounts did you create before finally giving in to the paywall? With today’s subscription models, customers have no real incentive to help the platform grow. Nascent token-based business models show early signs of promise. By giving ownership to stakeholders and allowing subscribers to benefit from future upside, startups can overcome the cold start problem. \nThough appealing, a playbook for tokenized business models has not yet emerged. I suspect this will change in the coming years, and I’m excited to improve my understanding of the subject.\nWho curates the curators? \nPlatforms like Twitter delegate this responsibility to their users, who have to go through a long and arduous process of following a huge number of people to ultimately arrive at a self-curated timeline that mimics their interests. Some centralize their curation — at OnDeck, you trust that they are doing the work of selecting who can join their network. Yet others stay away from curation in favor of more traditional crowdsourcing. The spectrum is wide. \nHow do you find the search engine in the first place? \nI started this piece arguing that Google needs to be unbundled. That’s a catchy headline but, in truth, I believe that until you can build habitual recall into your product, Google will be an important part of how your engine gets discovered in the first place. Zillow and Airbnb are examples of search companies that enjoy a good amount of direct traffic, but SEO was a big part of their early strategy. By being among the first to create the definitive page for a home, they benefited from an SEO land grab that has been hard to displace since.\nWe are far from achieving the grand vision of the Internet.
