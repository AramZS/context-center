The exact\n               nature of the selection algorithm is at the server's discretion\n               but is intended to be consistent, for example, always selecting\n               the Memento that is nearest in time relative to the requested\n               datetime, always selecting the Memento that is nearest in the\n               past relative to the requested datetime, etc.\n             \n      </p>\n      <div><a name=\"rfc.section.3.1.p.5\"></a></div>\n      <p>\n               Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most systems, the value of\n               the \"Memento-Datetime\" header returned by a server may differ\n               (significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in\n               \"Accept-Datetime\".\n             \n      </p>\n      <div><a name=\"rfc.section.3.1.p.6\"></a></div>\n      <p>\n               Although a Memento encapsulates a prior state of an Original\n               Resource, the entity-body returned in response to an HTTP GET\n               request issued against a Memento may very well not be\n               byte-to-byte the same as an entity-body that was previously\n               returned by that Original Resource. Various reasons exist why\n               there are significant chances these would be different yet do\n               convey substantially the same information. These include format\n               migrations as part of a digital preservation strategy,\n               URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives, and the addition\n               of banners as a means to brand Web archives.\n             \n      </p>\n      <div><a name=\"rfc.section.3.1.p.7\"></a></div>\n      <p> When negotiating in the datetime dimension, the regular\n               content negotiation dimensions (media type, character encoding,\n               language, and compression) remain available.  It is the TimeGate\n               server's responsibility to honor (or not) such content\n               negotiation, and in doing so it MUST always first select a\n               Memento that meets the user agent's datetime preference, and\n               then consider honoring regular content negotiation for it. As a\n               result of this approach, the returned Memento will not\n               necessarily meet the user agent's regular content negotiation\n               preferences. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the server\n               provides \"memento\" links in the HTTP \"Link\" header pointing at\n               Mementos that do meet the user agent's regular content\n               negotiation requests and that have a value for the\n               \"Memento-Datetime\" header in the temporal vicinity of the user\n               agent's preferred datetime value.\n             \n      </p>\n      <div><a name=\"rfc.section.3.1.p.8\"></a></div>\n      <p>A user agent that engages in datetime negotiation with a\n               resource typically starts by issuing an HTTP HEAD, not GET,\n               request with an \"Accept-Datetime\" header in order to determine\n               how to proceed.

It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a\n           given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and\n           TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation\n           that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred\n           datetime.  TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that\n           encapsulate prior states of the given resource.  The framework also\n           facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior\n           state of another resource.\n         \n      </p>\n\n      <h2><a name=\"rfc.status\">Status of this Memo</a></h2>\n\n      <p>\n         \n   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational purposes.</p>\n\n   <p>This is a contribution to the RFC Series, independently of any other\n   RFC stream.

For any given Original\n         Resource several Mementos may exist, each one reflecting a frozen\n         prior state of the Original Resource.\n         \n      </p>\n      \n      <p>Examples are:</p>\n      \n      <p>Mementos for Original Resource http://www.ietf.org/ are as follows:</p>\n      \n      <ul>\n             \n         <li>http://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/</li>\n             \n         <li>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://www.ietf.org/</li>\n         \n      </ul>\n      \n      <p>Mementos for Original Resource http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol are as follows:</p>\n      \n      <ul>\n             \n         <li>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=366806574</li> \n             \n         <li>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=33912</li>\n             \n         <li>http://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</li>\n         \n      </ul>\n      \n      <p>Mementos for Original Resource http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/ are as follows:</p>\n      \n      <ul>\n             \n         <li>http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/</li>\n             \n         <li>http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/</li>\n             \n         <li>http://archive.is/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/</li>\n         \n         \n      </ul>\n      \n      <p>\n             In the abstract, the Memento framework introduces a mechanism to\n             access versions of Web resources that:\n           \n      </p>\n      \n      <ul>\n             \n             \n         <li>Is fully distributed in the sense that resource versions may\n                  reside on multiple servers, and that any such server is likely\n                  only aware of the versions it holds;\n         </li>\n             \n             \n         <li>Uses the global notion of datetime as a resource version\n                indicator and access key;\n         </li>\n             \n             \n         <li>Leverages the following primitives\n                  of <a href=\"#W3C.REC-aww-20041215\" title=\"Architecture of the World Wide Web\">[W3C.REC-aww-20041215]</a>: resource,\n                  resource state, representation, content negotiation, and\n                  link.\n         </li>\n             \n           \n      </ul>\n      \n      <p>The core components of Memento's mechanism to access resource\n           versions are:\n      </p>\n      \n      \n      <ol>\n             \n         <li>The abstract notion of the state of an Original Resource\n                (URI-R) as it existed at datetime T.

The exact\n               nature of the selection algorithm is at the server's discretion\n               but is intended to be consistent, for example, always selecting\n               the Memento that is nearest in time relative to the requested\n               datetime, always selecting the Memento that is nearest in the\n               past relative to the requested datetime, etc.\n             \n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n               Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most systems, the value of\n               the \"Memento-Datetime\" header returned by a server may differ\n               (significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in\n               \"Accept-Datetime\".\n             \n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n               Although a Memento encapsulates a prior state of an Original\n               Resource, the entity-body returned in response to an HTTP GET\n               request issued against a Memento may very well not be\n               byte-to-byte the same as an entity-body that was previously\n               returned by that Original Resource. Various reasons exist why\n               there are significant chances these would be different yet do\n               convey substantially the same information. These include format\n               migrations as part of a digital preservation strategy,\n               URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives, and the addition\n               of banners as a means to brand Web archives.\n             \n      </p>\n      \n      <p> When negotiating in the datetime dimension, the regular\n               content negotiation dimensions (media type, character encoding,\n               language, and compression) remain available.  It is the TimeGate\n               server's responsibility to honor (or not) such content\n               negotiation, and in doing so it MUST always first select a\n               Memento that meets the user agent's datetime preference, and\n               then consider honoring regular content negotiation for it. As a\n               result of this approach, the returned Memento will not\n               necessarily meet the user agent's regular content negotiation\n               preferences. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the server\n               provides \"memento\" links in the HTTP \"Link\" header pointing at\n               Mementos that do meet the user agent's regular content\n               negotiation requests and that have a value for the\n               \"Memento-Datetime\" header in the temporal vicinity of the user\n               agent's preferred datetime value.\n             \n      </p>\n      \n      <p>A user agent that engages in datetime negotiation with a\n               resource typically starts by issuing an HTTP HEAD, not GET,\n               request with an \"Accept-Datetime\" header in order to determine\n               how to proceed.

           Abstract\n      \n     \n     \n           The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past\n           Web.  It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a\n           given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and\n           TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation\n           that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred\n           datetime.  TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that\n           encapsulate prior states of the given resource.  The framework also\n           facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior\n           state of another resource.\n         \n      \n\n      Status of this Memo\n\n      \n         \n   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational purposes.\n\n   This is a contribution to the RFC Series, independently of any other\n   RFC stream.

\"request\", \"response\",\n         \"entity-body\", \"content negotiation\", \"user agent\", and \"server\" as\n         described in [RFC2616], and it uses the terms\n         \"representation\" and \"resource state\" as described\n         in [W3C.REC-aww-20041215].\n         \n      \n      \n      \n           In addition, the following terms specific to the Memento framework\n

exist, and for which access to one of its prior states\n                may be required.\n              \n         \n           \n           \n         \n                Memento: A Memento for an Original Resource is a resource that\n                encapsulates a prior state of the Original Resource.  A Memento\n                for an Original Resource as it existed at time T is a resource\n                that encapsulates the state the Original Resource had at time T.\n              \n         \n           \n           \n         \n                TimeGate: A TimeGate for an Original Resource is a resource that\n                is capable of datetime negotiation to support access to prior\n                states of the Original Resource.\n              \n         \n           \n           \n         \n                TimeMap: A TimeMap for an Original Resource is a resource from\n                which a list of URIs of Mementos of the Original Resource is\n                available.\n              \n         \n           \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      1.2 \n         \n         Notational Conventions\n      \n      \n               The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\n               NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n               \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\n               in [RFC2119].\n             \n      \n      \n      \n               When needed for extra clarity, the following conventions are\n               used:\n             \n      \n      \n      \n               \n               \n         URI-R is used to denote the URI of an Original Resource.  \n               \n               \n         URI-G is used to denote the URI of a TimeGate.  \n               \n               \n         URI-M is used to denote the URI of a Memento.  \n               \n               \n         URI-T is used to denote the URI of a TimeMap.  \n               \n             \n      \n      1.3 \n         \n         Purpose\n      \n      \n      \n         The state of an Original Resource may change over time. Dereferencing\n         its URI at any specific moment yields a response that reflects the\n         resource's state at that moment: a representation of the resource's\n         state (e.g., \"200 OK\" HTTP status code), an indication of its\n         nonexistence (e.g., \"404 Not Found\" HTTP status code), a relation to\n         another resource (e.g., \"302 Found\" HTTP status code), etc.  However,\n         responses may also exist that reflect prior states of an Original\n         Resource: a representation of a prior state of the Original Resource,\n         an indication that the Original Resource did not exist at some time in\n         the past, a relation that the Original Resource had to another\n         resource at some time in the past, etc.  Mementos that provide such\n         responses exist in Web archives, content management systems, or\n         revision control systems, among others.  For any given Original\n         Resource several Mementos may exist, each one reflecting a frozen\n         prior state of the Original Resource.\n         \n      \n      \n      Examples are:\n      \n      Mementos for Original Resource http://www.ietf.org/ are as follows:\n      \n      \n             \n         http://web.archive.org/web/19970107171109/http://www.ietf.org/\n             \n         http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080906200044/http://www.ietf.org/\n         \n      \n      \n      Mementos for Original Resource http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol are as follows:\n      \n      \n             \n         http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&oldid=366806574 \n             \n         http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol&oldid=33912\n             \n         http://web.archive.org/web/20071011153017/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\n         \n      \n      \n      Mementos for Original Resource http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/ are as follows:\n      \n      \n             \n         http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-webarch-20041105/\n             \n         http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/\n             \n         http://archive.is/20120527002537/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n             In the abstract, the Memento framework introduces a mechanism to\n             access versions of Web resources that:\n           \n      \n      \n      \n             \n             \n         Is fully distributed in the sense that resource versions may\n                  reside on multiple servers, and that any such server is likely\n                  only aware of the versions it holds;\n         \n             \n             \n         Uses the global notion of datetime as a resource version\n                indicator and access key;\n         \n             \n             \n         Leverages the following primitives\n                  of [W3C.REC-aww-20041215]: resource,\n                  resource state, representation, content negotiation, and\n                  link.\n         \n             \n           \n      \n      \n      The core components of Memento's mechanism to access resource\n           versions are:\n      \n      \n      \n      \n             \n         The abstract notion of the state of an Original Resource\n                (URI-R) as it existed at datetime T.

It introduces two new headers (\"Accept-Datetime\" and\n         \"Memento-Datetime\") and introduces new values for two existing headers\n         (\"Vary\" and \"Link\").  Other HTTP headers are present or absent in\n         Memento response/request cycles as specified\n         by [RFC2616].\n         \n      \n      2.1.1 \n         \n         Accept-Datetime and Memento-Datetime\n      \n      \n         The \"Accept-Datetime\" request header is transmitted by a user agent to\n         indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To\n         that end, the \"Accept-Datetime\" header is conveyed in an HTTP request\n         issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value\n         indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original\n         Resource.\n         \n      \n      \n      \n             Example of an \"Accept-Datetime\" request header:\n           \n      \n      \n          Accept-Datetime: Thu, 31 May 2007 20:35:00 GMT\n\n        \n      \n         The \"Memento-Datetime\" response header is used by a server to indicate\n         that a response reflects a prior state of an Original Resource. Its\n         value expresses the datetime of that state. The URI of the Original\n         Resource for which the response reflects a prior state is provided as\n         the Target IRI of a link provided in the HTTP \"Link\" header that has a\n         Relation Type of \"original\"\n         (see Section 2.2).\n         \n      \n      \n      \n             The presence of a \"Memento-Datetime\" header and associated value\n             for a given response constitutes a promise that the resource state\n             reflected in the response will no longer change\n             (see Section 4.5.6).\n         \n      \n      \n      \n             Example of a \"Memento-Datetime\" response header:\n           \n      \n      \n          Memento-Datetime: Wed, 30 May 2007 18:47:52 GMT\n\n        \n      Values for the \"Accept-Datetime\" and \"Memento-Datetime\" headers\n             consist of a MANDATORY datetime expressed according to the\n             [RFC1123] format, which is formalized by the\n             rfc1123-date construction rule of the BNF\n             in Figure 1. This BNF is derived from \n               the HTTP-date construction of the BNF for Full Dates \n               provided in [RFC2616].

In the Memento framework, a TimeGate uses the \"Vary\"\n               header with a value that includes \"accept-datetime\" to convey\n               that datetime negotiation is possible.\n             \n      \n      \n      \n               For example, this use of the \"Vary\" header indicates that\n               datetime is the only dimension in which negotiation is possible:\n             \n      \n      \n            Vary: accept-datetime\n\n          \n      \n               The use of the \"Vary\" header in this example shows that both datetime negotiation and media type content negotiation\n         are possible:\n             \n      \n      \n            Vary: accept-datetime, accept\n\n          2.1.3 \n         \n         Link\n      \n      \n      \n               The Memento framework defines the \"original\", \"timegate\",\n               \"timemap\", and \"memento\" Relation Types to convey typed links\n               among Original Resources, TimeGates, Mementos, and TimeMaps.

Based on the responding server's knowledge of the\n                    past of the Original Resource, it selects a Memento of the\n                    Original Resource that best meets the user agent's datetime\n                    preference.  An overview is provided\n                    in Section 3.1; details\n                    are in Section 4.\n         \n               \n         TimeMaps: A TimeMap is a resource from which a list can be\n                    obtained that provides a comprehensive overview of the past of\n                    an Original Resource.  A server makes a TimeMap available that\n                    enumerates all Mementos that the server is aware of, along\n                    with their archival datetime.  A user agent can obtain the\n                    TimeMap and select Mementos from it.

Dashed lines depict HTTP transactions between user\n               agent and server.  The interactions are for a scenario where the\n               Original Resource resides on one server, whereas both its\n               TimeGate and Mementos reside on another\n               (Pattern 2.1\n               in Section 4).  Scenarios also exist\n               in which all these resources are on the same server (for\n               example, content management systems) or all are on different\n               servers (for example, an aggregator of TimeGates).\n             \n      \n      \n      \n            \n            1: UA --- HTTP HEAD/GET; Accept-Datetime: T ----------------> URI-R\n2: UA <-- HTTP 200; Link: URI-G ----------------------------- URI-R\n3: UA --- HTTP HEAD/GET; Accept-Datetime: T ----------------> URI-G\n4: UA <-- HTTP 302; Location: URI-M; Vary; Link: \n      URI-R,URI-T ------------------------------------------> URI-G\n5: UA --- HTTP GET URI-M; Accept-Datetime: T ---------------> URI-M\n6: UA <-- HTTP 200; Memento-Datetime: T; Link:  \n      URI-R,URI-T,URI-G ------------------------------------- URI-M\n\n            \n          Figure 2: A Datetime Negotiation Request/Response Chain\n      \n      \n               \n               \n         Step 1:\n         \n                    The user agent that wants to access a prior state of\n                    the Original Resource issues an HTTP HEAD/GET against URI-R\n                    that has an \"Accept-Datetime\" HTTP header with a value of the\n                    datetime of the desired state.\n                  \n         \n               \n               \n         Step 2:\n         \n                    The response from URI-R includes an HTTP \"Link\" header\n                    with a Relation Type of \"timegate\" pointing at a TimeGate\n                    (URI-G) for the Original Resource.\n                  \n         \n               \n               \n         Step 3:\n         \n                    The user agent starts the datetime negotiation process\n                    with the TimeGate by issuing an HTTP GET request against URI-G\n                    that has an \"Accept-Datetime\" HTTP header with a value of the\n                    datetime of the desired prior state of the Original Resource.\n                  \n         \n               \n               \n         Step 4:\n         \n                    The response from URI-G includes a \"Location\" header\n                    pointing at a Memento (URI-M) for the Original Resource.

It also contains an HTTP \"Link\" header with a\n                    Relation Type of \"original\" pointing at the Original Resource\n                    (URI-R), with a Relation Type of \"timegate\" pointing at a\n                    TimeGate (URI-G) for the Original Resource, and with a\n                    Relation Type of \"timemap\" pointing at a TimeMap (URI-T) for\n                    the Original Resource.  The state that is expressed by the\n                    response is the state the Original Resource had at the\n                    archival datetime expressed in the \"Memento-Datetime\" header.\n                  \n         \n               \n             \n      \n      \n      \n               In order to respond to a datetime negotiation request, the\n               server uses an internal algorithm to select the Memento that\n               best meets the user agent's datetime preference. The exact\n               nature of the selection algorithm is at the server's discretion\n               but is intended to be consistent, for example, always selecting\n               the Memento that is nearest in time relative to the requested\n               datetime, always selecting the Memento that is nearest in the\n               past relative to the requested datetime, etc.\n             \n      \n      \n      \n               Due to the sparseness of Mementos in most systems, the value of\n               the \"Memento-Datetime\" header returned by a server may differ\n               (significantly) from the value conveyed by the user agent in\n               \"Accept-Datetime\".\n             \n      \n      \n      \n               Although a Memento encapsulates a prior state of an Original\n               Resource, the entity-body returned in response to an HTTP GET\n               request issued against a Memento may very well not be\n               byte-to-byte the same as an entity-body that was previously\n               returned by that Original Resource. Various reasons exist why\n               there are significant chances these would be different yet do\n               convey substantially the same information. These include format\n               migrations as part of a digital preservation strategy,\n               URI-rewriting as applied by some Web archives, and the addition\n               of banners as a means to brand Web archives.\n             \n      \n      \n       When negotiating in the datetime dimension, the regular\n               content negotiation dimensions (media type, character encoding,\n               language, and compression) remain available.  It is the TimeGate\n               server's responsibility to honor (or not) such content\n               negotiation, and in doing so it MUST always first select a\n               Memento that meets the user agent's datetime preference, and\n               then consider honoring regular content negotiation for it. As a\n               result of this approach, the returned Memento will not\n               necessarily meet the user agent's regular content negotiation\n               preferences. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the server\n               provides \"memento\" links in the HTTP \"Link\" header pointing at\n               Mementos that do meet the user agent's regular content\n               negotiation requests and that have a value for the\n               \"Memento-Datetime\" header in the temporal vicinity of the user\n               agent's preferred datetime value.\n             \n      \n      \n      A user agent that engages in datetime negotiation with a\n               resource typically starts by issuing an HTTP HEAD, not GET,\n               request with an \"Accept-Datetime\" header in order to determine\n               how to proceed. This strategy is related to the existence of\n               various server implementation patterns as will become clear in\n               Section 4.\n         \n               \n               \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      Details about the HTTP interactions involved in datetime\n             negotiation are provided in\n               Section 4.\n      \n      3.2 \n         \n         TimeMaps\n      \n      Figure 3 provides a schematic\n                 overview of a successful request/response chain that shows a\n                 user agent obtaining a TimeMap.

Content management systems and revision control\n               systems can support datetime negotiation in this way as they are\n               commonly aware of the version history of their own\n               resources.\n      \n      \n      The response to this request when datetime negotiation for\n                 this resource is supported depends on the negotiation style it\n                 uses (200-style or 302-style) and on the existence or absence\n                 of a URI-M for Mementos that is distinct from the URI-R of the\n                 associated Original Resource.

This pattern is typically implemented by\n                 servers for which the history of their resources is recorded\n                 in remote systems such as Web archives and transactional\n                 archives [Fitch].  But servers that\n                 maintain their own history, such as content management systems\n                 and version control systems, may also implement this pattern,\n                 for example, to distribute the load involved in responding to\n                 requests for current and prior representations of resources\n                 between different servers.\n      \n      \n      This pattern is summarized in the below table and is detailed\n                 in the remainder of this section.  Three cases exist that\n                 differ regarding the negotiation style that is used by the\n                 remote TimeGate and regarding the existence of a URI-M for\n                 Mementos that is distinct from the URI-G of the TimeGate.\n               \n      \n      \n         \n            \n               Pattern\n               Original Resource\n               TimeGate\n               Memento\n               Negotiation Style\n            \n         \n         \n            \n               Pattern 2.1\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-R\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-G\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-M\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               302\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n            \n            \n               Pattern 2.2\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-R\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-G\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-M\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               200\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n            \n            \n               Pattern 2.3\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-R\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-G\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               URI-G\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n               200\n                  \n                   \n                  \n                  \n               \n            \n         \n      \n      \n      The response by the Original Resource to the request shown\n                 in Figure 4 is the same for\n                 all three cases.

If a preferred\n                      TimeGate is associated with the Original Resource, then it\n                      MUST include a link with a \"timegate\" Relation Type that has\n                      the URI-G of the TimeGate as Target IRI.  If a preferred\n                      TimeMap is associated with the Original Resource, then it\n                      SHOULD include a link with a \"timemap\" Relation Type that\n                      has the URI-T of the TimeGate as Target IRI.

The\n                   user agent proceeds with finding a Memento for this Original\n                   Resource.

Hence, the response from a\n                 TimeMap could include a \"timegate\" link to a TimeGate via\n                 which prior TimeMap versions are available.

It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource."},"opengraph":{"title":false,"description":false,"url":false,"site_name":false,"locale":false,"type":false,"typeObject":{"published_time":false,"modified_time":false,"author":false,"publisher":false,"section":false,"tag":[]},"image":false},"twitter":{"site":false,"description":false,"card":false,"creator":false,"title":false,"image":false},"archivedData":{"link":false,"wayback":false}}}
