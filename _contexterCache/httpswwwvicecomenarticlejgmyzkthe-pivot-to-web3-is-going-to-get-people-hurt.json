What matters to investors is that Web3 is the hot new thing and the entrepreneurs are piling in. One venture capitalist, Hadley Harris, told me that roughly half the Web3 pitches he&#x2019;d recently looked over came from founders who weren&#x2019;t even in the space half a year ago. That&#x2019;s a claim backed up by Alchemy, a company that considers itself the Web3 infrastructural equivalent of Amazon Web Services; <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com//blog/alchemy-equity-investment\" target=\"_blank\">it said in February</a> that &#x201C;hundreds of established Web2 companies&#x201D; are pivoting into Web3 using its platform.

One Ottawa-based entrepreneur, worried the world was passing him by, surprised his employees on a company Zoom call by saying he was pivoting the entire company into Web3. &#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Guys, this is the future and this is where everything is going,&#x2019;&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;&#x2018;If we miss this boat, I don&apos;t think we can ever get back on.&#x2019;&#x201D; (The company, which had been a print-on-demand platform, now helps creators build 3D NFTs to sell to fans in the metaverse.)</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Like a lot of his fellow entrepreneurs, Nick Gerard, the CEO and co- founder of Norby, a startup focused on the creator economy,&#xA0; started to notice last year that one by one, his competitors were also diving headfirst into the world of crypto and Web3. Gerard said potential investors in Norby were pushing him to take the Web3 leap as well.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But Gerard couldn&#x2019;t help but feel confused by the whole thing. His customers, the people he thought mattered most, rarely showed much interest in Web3 technologies at all. &#x201C;I can count on one hand the number of times I have actually heard &#x2018;NFTs&#x2019; come out of one of these people&apos;s mouths,&#x201D; he told me.

In the first three months of the year, the top 15 venture firms poured more money into Web3 and DeFi early- and seed-stage deals than any other area, the third straight quarter they have done so, according to <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2022-emerging-tech-indicator?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=etr_market_update&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=daily_pitch&amp;utm_content=q1_2022_emerging_tech_indicator\" target=\"_blank\">the research firm Pitchbook</a>. In total, the early- and seed-stage Web3 world nabbed $2 billion from top firms last quarter, more than double what the next-highest sector, biotechnology, received, and triple what traditional fintech got. Those figures understate the total level of interest&#x2014;and money&#x2014;in the space. Blockchain companies have raised at least $9.5 billion after receiving $18 billion in funding in 2021, according to numbers the research firm CrunchBase provided to Motherboard. And more firepower is on the way. In late May, amid plunging crypto prices, one of Web3&#x2019;s biggest institutional backers, the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, announced it had raised a monstrous <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-fund-four/\" target=\"_blank\">$4.5 billion crypto fund</a> following a series of high-profile investments into Web3 projects like play-to-earn game <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ag/the-metaverse-has-bosses-too-meet-the-managers-of-axie-infinity\">Axie Infinity</a> and the parent company of the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvn5a/bored-apes-buzzfeed-and-the-battle-for-the-future-of-the-internet\">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>.</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><div class=\"abc__article_embed\" data-component=\"RelatedArticleBlock\"><div class=\"vice-card vice-card--light\"><div class=\"vice-card__content\"><div class=\"vice-card-rubric vice-card-rubric--light vice-card__vice-card-rubric\"><a class=\"vice-card-rubric__label vice-card-rubric__link\" href=\"/en/section/tech\">Tech</a></div><h3 class=\"vice-card-hed vice-card-hed--light vice-card__vice-card-hed\"><a href=\"/en/article/88g3ag/the-metaverse-has-bosses-too-meet-the-managers-of-axie-infinity\" class=\"vice-card-hed__link\">The Metaverse Has Bosses Too.

Mills&#x2019; company had been a struggling remote-work startup before he transformed it into a Web3 gaming platform. The moment he started talking about his Web3 vision, investor interest skyrocketed. &#x201C;It was a tremendous difference,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0; &#x201C;There were people who I didn&apos;t even meet with who were just committing over email without ever even talking to me.&#x201D; He had planned to raise $2 million, only to receive $20 million in commitments in two weeks. &#x201C;We stopped because it just was incredibly overwhelming.&#x201D;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p><strong>&#x201C;</strong>Something big is happening,&#x201D; Mills added. &#x201C;A lot of people are trying to get in on it, and a lot of people are more afraid of <em>not</em> getting in.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>What exactly they are getting in on is harder to pin down. The term &#x201C;Web3&#x201D; is sometimes attributed to Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, who, in 2014, described an idealized version of the web in which the system placed no trust in organizations but near-complete trust in blockchain technology. But it didn&#x2019;t enter the mainstream cultural vernacular <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=web3,web%203.0\" target=\"_blank\">until last year</a>, when it started to serve as a catchall (and, coincidentally, a venture-led rebranding) for the collection of controversial&#xA0; financial-technology products that include cryptocurrencies, blockchains, non-fungible tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations (or &#x201C;DAOs&#x201D;), the metaverse, and decentralized financial (or DeFi) products.&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\" class=\"abc__quote abc__quote--pullquote\"><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a collective Theranos.

In such a world, people could use and even monetize their NFTs on multiple platforms, rather than just on, say, Instagram. Such a system, boosters believe&#x2014;or, at least, claim to believe&#x2014;will lead to a fairer, more communal version of the web, one that will wrest control back from technological giants that have profited off people&#x2019;s data and creativity, creating a world where community comes before all else. Much of the ideological rhetoric hence involves talk of using Web3 &#x201C;<a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">to truly empower financial inclusion</a>&#x201D; (again, Andreessen Horowitz&#x2019;s words) by bringing people into the fold who have been marginalized by the traditional financial structure.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Such arguments are inarguably alluring. Very few people feel the financial and internet structures that underpin society could not be vastly improved. But they also belie the fact that professional investors do not push their money into the middle of the craps table solely in order to better the world. As Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University, succinctly put it: &#x201C;The reason why venture capitalists are pushing all of this is to make money.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>And in Web3, the venture class and other professional investors have found a uniquely appealing set of circumstances they believe will allow them to make a giant pile of money that does not rely on vast leaps in virtual reality or haptics technology&#x2014;sometimes by pulling off an impressive degree of regulatory arbitrage, other times by taking advantage of a wholly new kind of internet marketplace.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;If there is any innovation in crypto assets, it&#x2019;s not in software engineering but in financial engineering,&#x201D; the London-based software engineer and crypto critic Stephen Diehl has written.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Allen, who studies financial regulation, sees the rhetoric around empowerment and inclusion as little more than a&#xA0; &#x201C;cynical&#x201D; ploy.

The CEO of the startup studio All Turtles and the virtual camera application mmhmm, as well as a former VC at General Catalyst, Libin has made a career out of searching out companies that solve real problems with clear business models. But as he started hearing from more and more Web3 companies, he found himself unable to understand what benefit came from developing certain projects on the blockchain as opposed to, for example, using an internal database. When he started to challenge some of the pitches he received, he didn&#x2019;t like the answers he got.

capitalists have backed industries that have changed the world and created millions of jobs, most famously during those early years of the internet. Less talked about is the fact that the venture class has gotten it wrong as well, said Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner, who also studies the venture industry. As an example, Lerner cited the VC-funded cleantech boom and bust at the end of the 2000s as a recent example.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;It turned out that not only was the technology a lot harder than they thought, but many of the businesses were just extremely poorly run, and some of the best firms in the business were just blinded by their enthusiasm into burning huge amounts of investor money,&#x201D; Lerner said.&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"body-image\" data-component=\"ImageBlock\"><div class=\"body-image__img\"><div><picture class=\"responsive-image lazyloader--lazy lazyloader--lowres\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcSet=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1654089906495-screen-shot-2022-06-01-at-92039-am.png?resize=20:*\"/><source media=\"(min-width: 700px)\" srcSet=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1654089906495-screen-shot-2022-06-01-at-92039-am.png?resize=20:*\"/><source media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcSet=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1654089906495-screen-shot-2022-06-01-at-92039-am.png?resize=20:*\"/><img class=\"responsive-image__img\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-01 at 9.20.39 AM.png\"/></picture></div></div></div></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article dropcap\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tomasz Tunguz didn&#x2019;t become interested in Web3 because of its ideological underpinnings. Like a lot of investors, he saw a chance to make a lot of money because of the economic particularities of the Web3 ecosystem.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tunguz, a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures who writes <a href=\"https://tomtunguz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a popular blog</a> about the industry, became active in the Web3 market in the first half of last year after he noticed the businesses were both capital efficient and could scale to enormous size. In August, Tomasz like many others watched in amazement as the price of the blockchain platform Solana&#x2019;s token rose from $40 to $190 by mid-September, briefly reaching a market cap of almost <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/\" target=\"_blank\">$80 billion</a> by November.</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;That really opened up a lot of people&apos;s eyes to the size of these companies,&#x201D; Tunguz said. &#x201C;The scale compels you to figure out what&apos;s going on.&#x201D;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The closer he looked, the greater the investment opportunity seemed. For one thing, the businesses did not have clear metrics by which they could be valued. Over the last 20 years, investors and entrepreneurs have together developed fairly reliable, standardized financial models that allow them to confidently place values on traditional software businesses after comparing them to similar older ones. &#x201C;Most software businesses are really well understood. A startup walks in, and the venture capitalist just as much as the private market investors know exactly what it ought to be worth,&#x201D; said Tunguz.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;In Web3, that&apos;s not the case,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;Nobody has any idea how to value these businesses.&#x201D; He doesn&#x2019;t see that as a bad thing but rather as indicative that the Web3 industry is in a period of &#x201C;broad invention as opposed to optimization.&#x201D;</p></span><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\" class=\"abc__quote abc__quote--pullquote\"><p>&#x201c;Nobody has any idea how to value these businesses &#x2026; It's so new that people aren't worried about unit economics,&#x201d; one venture capitalist said.</p></blockquote><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#xA0;&#x201C;I haven&apos;t walked into a single pitch with a Web3 company where the words &#x2018;cost of customer acquisition&#x2019; or &#x2018;payback period&#x2019; has been uttered. It&apos;s so new that people aren&apos;t worried about unit economics,&#x201D; Tunguz said. (Raghavendra Rau, a Cambridge finance professor who helped discover the &#x201C;dotcom&#x201D; effect, agreed the Web3 industry&#x2019;s underlying fundamentals were &#x201C;tough to decipher,&#x201D; as did others.)</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tunguz knows that lack of focus on economic fundamentals will sound &#x201C;crazy&#x201D; to some people, and he does believe that a &#x201C;significantly higher&#x201D; percentage of Web3 ventures will fail than the typical crop of startups found in a venture fund&#x2019;s portfolio. But he also sees Web3&#x2019;s unclear valuation metrics as a financial opportunity compared to the world of Web 2.0, which has become so well understood that it has proven harder for investors to gain an edge.&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;One of the ways of making lots of money is to have information asymmetry,&#x201D; Tunguz said. &#x201C;If you know something I don&apos;t about a company and you trade on that information, you&apos;re gonna make a bunch of money, right? In the stock market, it&apos;s illegal. It&apos;s called MNPI&#x2014;material nonpublic information. You can&apos;t do that. In the private markets, you can.&#x201D;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>There was one more reason Tunguz got drawn to the Web3 market: He started to see the financial potential of one of crypto&#x2019;s central innovations, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crypto-token.asp\" target=\"_blank\">token</a>. The term &#x201C;token&#x201D; can mean many things in the crypto sphere, which makes it difficult to define in any way that is simultaneously all-encompassing and useful. Most simply, it is a tradable unit on any blockchain, but it has come to take numerous forms and functions: Tokens can be currencies, as they are with Bitcoin; they can represent voting shares, as with DAO governance tokens; they can be digital collectibles, as with an NFT of a Bored Ape; and they can be earned through online work, as they are with the &#x201C;play-to-earn&#x201D; game <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ag/the-metaverse-has-bosses-too-meet-the-managers-of-axie-infinity\">Axie Infinity</a>.</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But professional investors have also started to view them as tradable shares of crypto projects. One such firm is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/multicoin-capital-solana-arweave-bitcoin-returns-f8e9bf82-c8d8-4917-a9d8-f0ca208bd63b.html\" target=\"_blank\">Multicoin Capital</a>, an Austin-based investment firm that &#x201C;primarily&#x201D; invests in tokens rather than traditional equity in startups, according to Kyle Samani, its co-founder and managing partner. Multicoin&#x2019;s recent returns have been nothing short of astonishing; its <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/multicoin-capital-solana-arweave-bitcoin-returns-f8e9bf82-c8d8-4917-a9d8-f0ca208bd63b.html\" target=\"_blank\">hedge fund assets reportedly</a> shot up 20,200 percent between October 2017 and December 2021, and its venture fund secured a 28x return. Samani said he&#x2019;s figured out how to approach investment in &#x201C;crypto assets&#x201D;&#x2014;he believes the term &#x201C;cryptocurrency&#x201D; to be a misnomer&#x2014;similarly to how a traditional investor might approach the analysis of a stock.&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;You can think of the mechanisms by which these tokens capture value to be comparable to the equity of a startup,&#x201D; Samani told Motherboard. &#x201C;Many of these assets capture revenue directly in the same way that a startup would have revenue. And if an asset captured revenue, then you can model the valuation using a discounted cash-flow model.&#x201D; Such descriptions are the reason many believe tokens should be regulated like an investment contract, or a security, since people invest in them &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp#:~:text=The%20Howey%20Test%20refers%20to,Securities%20Exchange%20Act%20of%201934.\" target=\"_blank\">with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others</a>&#x201D;&#x2014;the legal criteria for qualifying as a security.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;The entirety of most web3 epiphanies is &#x2018;what if instead of selling products we sold shares instead?&#x2019;&#x201D; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1483756578754813952\" target=\"_blank\">Meta product manager and frequent crypto cynic Dare Obasanjo</a> has written.&#xA0;</p></span><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\" class=\"abc__quote abc__quote--pullquote\"><p>&#x201c;You can think of the mechanisms by which these tokens capture value to be comparable to the equity of a startup,&#x201d; said a partner at a crypto-focused investment firm.</p></blockquote><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tunguz has <a href=\"https://tomtunguz.com/four-fundamental-innovations-web3/\" target=\"_blank\">himself referred</a> to token-based reward systems as &#x201C;paying customers in &#x2018;equity,&#x2019;&#x201D; writing that as &#x201C;the network becomes more valuable, so does the user&#x2019;s stake in the company.&#x201D; Doing so provides a reason for initial users to be invested in the company&#x2019;s success, sometimes even before the company knows what product it&#x2019;s going to make. This is why venture capitalists have taken to saying things like &#x201C;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fintechjunkie/status/1512089054333997059\" target=\"_blank\">Web2 companies start with product. Web3 companies start with community</a>.&#x201D; The tokens bring the people. Inspired by Axie Infinity, for example, Alex Kehr adopted a token-based approach with his startup, Superlocal, a version of Foursquare for the 2020s where people earn &#x201C;crypto when you go places.&#x201D; The token, he said, would give people &#x201C;something to do in our app when nobody&apos;s there yet.&#x201D; (He considers play-to-earn tokens, in particular, less likely to be deemed securities in the future.)&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Andreessen Horowitz, in its recent &#x201C;<a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">State of Crypto</a>&#x201D; report, argued that the token-focused structure of Web3 companies aligned the incentives of users, creators, builders, and investors in a way untokenized companies could not. &#x201C;Web3 aligns network participants to work together toward a common goal&#x2014;the growth of the network,&#x201D; the report stated. Together, so the line of thinking goes, they all can theoretically make it.</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But Tunguz (and others) saw opportunities for professional Web3 investors that those stuck in the earlier iteration of the web could not access. He realized the sector was broadly well suited for &#x201C;regulatory arbitrage,&#x201D; a practice in which businesses move to jurisdictions with more favorable laws or position themselves as one type of company rather than another in order avoid regulatory oversight (say, a ride-sharing company that positions itself as an app startup instead of a cab company). As Tunguz put it, the &#x201C;the regulation doesn&#x2019;t exist&#x201D; yet in Web3, which allows the companies to access funds not available to more-traditional companies.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Traditionally, venture capitalists have had to wait years before they can receive a payout for their investments, usually during an initial public offering. Since tokens could be sold at any time, Tunguz realized Web3 investors in them had access to an asset with &#x201C;immediate liquidity&#x201D; instead, which can lead to a return even if the company never goes public. If they do, all the better: the equity investor can then cash out twice.</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>One other token-related process&#x2014;known as &#x201C;staking&#x201D;&#x2014;proved particularly enticing to Tunguz. To him, it seemed as sure of a thing as they come in finance. With staking, the owner of the token hands them over for a project to use as liquidity&#x2014;for crypto loans, to take one example&#x2014;and in exchange earns &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-staking\" target=\"_blank\">a percentage-rate reward over time</a>,&#x201D; as the crypto exchange Coinbase puts it. This, Tunguz realized, meant he could make money from a token regardless of whether its price went up or down. Soon enough, he was actively staking tokens in order to generate what he viewed as a remarkably high &#x201C;interest rate.&#x201D; (&quot;Tokens can generate somewhere between like 15 to, let&apos;s say, 100 percent in fixed income,&#x201D; Tunguz said.)</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The discovery of such enormous fixed income in the Web3 space proved of financial interest to VCs, but Tunguz expects it will prove exceedingly exciting to institutional investors who have been focused on the bond market&#x2014;&#x201C;the people who buy mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, collateralized debt obligations, basically the stuff that caused the 2008 financial crisis,&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;Those are the big institutional pools of capital that really want to get into DeFi because they can generate those yields.&#x201D;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;These big institutions are looking at these crypto tokens and saying if I can isolate myself from whether or not the price of the token goes up or down, but if I can capture the yield on a consistent basis, then I can generate maybe 10 times what I could on a bond,&#x201D; he continued.&#xA0;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The risk inherent in such a system became clear, though, soon after we spoke.

Once people started to lose confidence in the sustainability of that yield, they rushed to pull their money out, leading to Terra&#x2019;s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, losing its peg to the U.S. dollar and a dramatic crash in its sister cryptocurrency, Luna.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Within days, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/147668/terra-pantera-capital-cashed-out-80-investment-before-ust-crash\" target=\"_blank\">one of Terraform Labs&#x2019; early and biggest investors</a>, the crypto-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, had quietly cashed out &#x201C;roughly&#x201D; four-fifths of its investment ahead of UST&#x2019;s collapse, a little under $170 million on a $1.7 million investment. The news infuriated many retail investors, who saw it as proof of what many in crypto suspected: professional investors gaining an early edge, loudly pumping up the project, quietly cashing out&#x2014;the dump&#x2014;and then moving on to the next token.&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>A video clip of the investors and podcasters Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya seemingly joking about dumping their Solana tokens <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qma4ry/solana_vc_investors_appear_to_be_laughing_about/\" target=\"_blank\">drew similar ire</a> last year, as the blockchain was heavily supported by professional investors early on. &#x201C;One way an impatient VC could manipulate a project is by insisting that a startup offer tokens as part of their project, and require that a certain amount of tokens be set aside for the VC,&#x201D; the <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/theres-something-off-about-apecoin?s=r\" target=\"_blank\">technology journalist Casey Newton</a> recently wrote. &#x201C;That way, once the tokens become available for trading on public crypto exchanges, VCs can cash out part of their investment years ahead of schedule. Or, if the project fails before it can sell or go public, the VC can earn a profit on an investment that would have otherwise been a loss.&#x201D;</p></span></div><div class=\"\"><span><div class=\"adph adph--border\"><div class=\"ac-w-ph__dsc\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"ac-w-ph\"><div class=\"ph ph-longform-scroll\"><div class=\"vice-ad__container\"><span class=\"vice-ad\"></span></div></div></div></div></span></div><div class=\"long-form__body-group\"><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Newton made the comments following the release of ApeCoin token, all but officially associated with Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, or BAYC.

why many in the crypto sphere have become suspicious of the professional investor class. Web3 projects have started requiring VCs to lock up their holding to avoid a professional pump-and-dump, and VCs have been reduced to writing about why people <em>should</em> take their money. (&#x201C;There are many alternatives to venture capital these days, particularly in web3, but there are few, if any, alternatives that stick with you, when times are tough,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://avc.com/2021/12/why-web3/\" target=\"_blank\">the investor Fred Wilson wrote</a> in December.)&#xA0;</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>And yet, the VCs&#x2019; influence over the startup system remains unquestionable.

He started to believe that tokens, rather than the ideological &#x201C;future of a fully decentralized internet,&#x201D; were behind a lot of the investor interest in Web3, he told me. As he sees it, an investment firm could invest in a startup in exchange for equity and inside information and then negotiate a hoard of early tokens. &#x201C;What I have now is asymmetric access to information,&#x201D; Gerard said. &#x201C;I have a direct line to a founder that every single person in the Discord doesn&apos;t have. I have access to financial information. I know if user adoption is tanking. I know if usage is skyrocketing.

Who is doing that in Web3 is difficult to decipher. An investor accused Cummings herself of bolting on an unnecessary Web3 element when she pitched him on the Petaverse Network, a Web3 project in which people build digital pets that can then live with them in various metaverses. &#x201C;He turned us down, saying I don&apos;t see why you need blockchain,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;That&apos;s true. You could store it in a database.&#x201D; She contended that the potential interoperability and ownership of the Web3-based idea &#x201C;made it better&#x201D; and went on to raise $7 million, double what she set out to raise.</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>What everyone can seem to agree on is that the boom has created a lot of vaporware and useless entrepreneurial attempts to get rich quick, even if no one wants to name names on the record.&#xA0;</p></span><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\" class=\"abc__quote abc__quote--pullquote\"><p>&#x201c;Tack on Web3, and investors will throw money blindly and inflate valuations 2-3x.&#x201d;</p></blockquote><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists alike described companies that bolt on a Web3 element in order to raise a few more bucks as &#x201C;grifters.&#x201D; Venture capitalists say such companies are easy to spot.

Allen, the law professor who studies financial regulation, has spent much of her time recently studying the similarities between financial products that make up Web3 and the collection of instruments that led to the Great Recession.

The two are different&#x2014;credit default swaps allow numerous people to make a bet on a bond&#x2019;s future performance&#x2014;but at the end of the day, both help greatly increase potential leverage in the financial system, she said.</p></span><span class=\"abc__textblock size--article\" data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&#x201C;Leverage is great in good times, because it allows you to multiply your profits. But it means that the system is very much more fragile, because even small amounts of losses on your investments will wipe you out,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;What we have with tokens is another way of creating leverage.

Axie, developed by Vietnam-based studio Sky Mavis, centers on NFTs of monsters called Axies that form a team whose battles earn players Smooth Love Potion (SLP) tokens. The game features its own blockchain, named Ronin, to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions for SLP, Axie’s governance token (AXS), and Ronin’s native token (RON). Battling is basic, akin to if your entire team of Pokémon battled at once. Axies, as well as other in-game items, are represented by NFTs which can be bought or sold on an in-game market. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__embed article__embed--vice\\\\\\\" data-related-article=\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\" data-children-count=\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003ciframe src=\\\\\\\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/3abn8b/embed\\\\\\\" frameborder=\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\" style=\\\\\\\"border:0px none;margin:0px\\\\\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe rise of play-to-earn games, however, has not been as clear-cut as some suggest.

To play Axie at the highest level of the game—to be, effectively, a boss—you need start-up capital. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"text-center\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003e*\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eTo start playing Axie Infinity, you need to buy three Axie NFTs—an investment that, when crypto markets were stronger, cost well over a thousand U.S. dollars. Today, the cost hovers around $300. Axies can also be bred―for a fee that grows each time―using a basic tripartite genetics system allows for selection for different traits as well as random permutations. These newer and potentially stronger Axies NFTs can be minted for use in teams, or sold on marketplaces. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eNot everyone has enough money IRL to be their own boss in the metaverse, however. That's why you can also loan your Axies to players unable to afford their own in exchange for a cut of any profits they generate, which can run from 20 to 50 percent. Manager cuts can go even higher, with “ranges from 30% - 75% cut per scholar based on their monthly rewards”  according to Axie Infinity’s co-founder and chief operating officer Aleksander Larsen (also known as \\\\\\\"Psycheout\\\\\\\" online).

This sparked a rally that took the coin all the way up to a recent peak of $0.039, which was still ten times less than its all-time high. That rally has since evaporated, with the price spending the weeks since floating around $0.02.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eIn the Feb. 3 Substack post \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://axie.substack.com/p/upcoming-season-20-and-economic-balancing\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eannouncing\\u003c/a\\u003e a host of coming reforms, Sky Mavis stated that, starting Feb. 9, SLP rewards would be removed from some game modes entirely and significantly reduced in others. The goal was to slow down the daily production of SLP, cap it, then eventually deflate it and rescue the token’s price from its death spiral.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\\\\\\"We know that this is painful medicine,” the blog post said. “The Axie economy requires drastic and decisive action now or we risk total and permanent economic collapse. That would be far more painful.\\\\\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eSky Mavis’ Substack post pointed out that four times as much SLP is being minted as what’s being burned; the only way to remove SLP in circulation and counter the massive pressures to constantly expand the supply (at great cost to the token’s value) is to “burn” it, usually by spending it on another feature of the game’s ecosystem―here, that means on breeding new Axies and making that breeding cost increasingly more SLP. New burn mechanisms will be added in due time, with the developers mentioning cosmetics, upgrades to Axie body parts, in-game emojis, special breeding events, and more. For now, however, these moves will have to suffice.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\\\\\\"We believe that these economic changes will allow us to start righting the ship and getting the economy moving in the right direction. We know that it will be key to execute on delivering new burn mechanisms this year,” the blog post concludes. “These issuance reductions will not be enough to get our economic engine back to full strength, but they are a needed step as we build towards a fully-functioning and sustainable economy.\\\\\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eOver email, Larsen was optimistic about the future of his game and its token economy. “Sustainability of the Axie economy is critical and requires us to find an equilibrium, which is why we introduced economic adjustments in February,” Larsen told Motherboard. “Being at the bleeding edge of gaming and blockchain technology makes Axie Infinity particularly susceptible to volatility, from internal and external factors.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eStill, with the token at historic lows, earnings have never been lower. Now, there are schemes to run more than one account in a bid to bypass the SLP cap. Some managers take painfully high cuts—more than 50 percent—and pair them with strict quotas to generate above-market returns. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__pull-quote\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\\\\\\"I don't really understand why some people hold, I've asked them and they tell me they are 'saving for something big'―essentially a big purchase.\\\\\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eAmong managers with large teams—anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of scholars—attitudes vary widely, but a common thread is that while managers can, and often do, earn big, scholars see only a fraction of those earnings, which are now declining.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eNear the peak of the market, Rafar spent $3,000 on his initial team and made it back earning just above $1,000 a month with two or three scholars, he said, while today he’s earning $300 a month. His scholars earn $25-50. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“It's not good,” Rafar told Motherboard, “but it helps with bills around the house.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eOthers are less optimistic about the game’s prospects overall, while paradoxically maintaining optimism for themselves. Troy, a U.S.-based manager with 24 scholars, told Motherboard that “if you want ROI and profits, I would stay away from Axie and crypto games unless it’s your money you’re willing to lose.” He then turned around and told Motherboard how he hoped it would still happen for him.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“My dream is to work remotely and become a content creator and stream,\\\\\\\" said Troy. \\\\\\\"I currently have about 80 Axies between my account and scholar accounts.

Still in their early years, the virtual worlds have spawned true believers, hype artists, and complex economies in places like The Sandbox, Decentraland, Somnium Space, and other metaverses, all of which are vying to become dominant players in the supposedly decentralized space. Virtual real estate companies are building music festival stages and Rodeo Drive–like digital neighborhoods; 3D architects are constructing villas and shopping malls; and digital landlords are renting out land to singers, artists, and NFT creators.

By comparison, Gord believes it’s “reasonably likely” that as many as 100 million-plus people could be inside Decentraland at all hours of the day and night, which “would make it the most populated city on Earth, and also perhaps the most desirable real estate on Earth.” He estimates the “growth opportunity” is “in the hundreds or thousands of X of ROI” and expects Decentraland to be not only “the next Facebook” but also “the biggest social network in the world,” which is why he believes his company’s investments to be financially sound. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“There is the possibility for there to be millions of metaverses that are created,” said Gord, who spoke to Motherboard while in Dubai. “But there is only one Facebook.

A former partner at a private equity firm and real estate developer for Standard Hotels, Yorio said that she approaches the job with a “traditional venture capital mindset” while also checking what certain Discord communities are excited about. Republic Realm, her company, owns 3,000 plots of land in 25 different metaverses and is tracking 180 different worlds as of last month.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__pull-quote\\\\\\\"\\u003e“Everybody's talking about the metaverse, but you go there, and there's nothing to do, there’s nothing to see,” said the CEO of a metaverse real estate company that develops land.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“Having been in it for four months longer than everybody else, we actually had a huge head start,” she told me.  \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eRepublic Realm isn’t a “corporate tycoon who just buys and holds,” she said.

The plots are modeled after vacation homes in the south of France, sci-fi video games, and Central American ecolodges (“for surfing on the beach”),  and come with customizable add-ons, like a hot tub. She compared purchasing a home in the metaverse to creating the modern version of a Myspace page. “It's like having your own website,” she said.  \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__media\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cpicture class=\\\\\\\"article__image\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 25em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=600:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 40.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=975:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 53.125em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=1275:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(min-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642695185368-plaza.png\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"plaza.png\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/picture\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__image-caption\\\\\\\"\\u003eOne of Republic Realm's proudest creations is Metajuku, a 16,000-square-foot digital shopping mall in Decentraland designed to look like the Harajuku.(Source: Republic Realm)\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eFor now, the most common selling point for joining the metaverse isn’t living, but shopping.

One customer is Robert Cumba, a crypto and NFT artist, who has purchased the SuperWorld land that makes up the well-trafficked areas of Sunset Strip in Los Angeles and Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. (Cumba has purchased digital land in Cryptovoxels and Decentraworld as well.) In SuperWorld, Cumba envisions creating crypto art installations along the Sunset Strip. “It'd be cool to just put some shades on. All of a sudden, the whole street completely, you know, flips a switch,” Cumba said. But he also wonders if there are promotional opportunities on his real estate in the heart of Hollywood as well. “I'm an artist, but I'm also an investor,” Cumba told me. “Maybe the Sunset Strip will have a Marvel lane or Disney lane.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eWhen I asked him if he owned any real world property, Cumba said he hasn’t gotten into “physical space hoarding” yet, though his dream is to have a gallery in Los Angeles, where he grew up.

He believes “proximity shouldn't be this big constrained resource anymore.” What’s exciting to him about the idea of the metaverse is the exact opposite—the prospect of living in something more closely resembling a post-scarcity world, where everyone can look how they want, have a large house, and then teleport into the city. “I don't know if we need to have it be restricted in the same way.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__pull-quote\\\\\\\"\\u003e“A lot of speculators aren't using the land that they're buying,” one digital landlord said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eSomnium Space addresses such concerns on its website, saying that while “there can be an unlimited amount of virtual land in theory… someone has to build a platform, devote thousands of hours creating, running servers, etc.” Plus, \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://somniumspace.com/terms-conditions/faq\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ethe company believes\\u003c/a\\u003e scarce land has benefits, creating an incentive to cultivate it into something worth spending time on. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__media\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cpicture class=\\\\\\\"article__image\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 25em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=600:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 40.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=975:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 53.125em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=1275:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(min-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642694866102-somniumspace2021-12-3232158.png\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"SomniumSpace_2021-12-3_232158.png\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/picture\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__image-caption\\\\\\\"\\u003eThe CEO of Somnium Space shows off a bathroom designed in his metaverse. (Source: Somnium Space)\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe fixed amount of land in Somnium Space has already led to the rise of digital landlords, like Bell, who estimates he rents out about 30 parcels on the platform. He typically finds potential tenants through Discord or Twitter, where singers, artists, NFT creators, and token creators say they’d love to create inside the metaverse but “can't believe how expensive land is.” Bell, who had already been a landlord in real life, says he’s developed a “pretty good business niche” renting land each year for a year at a time. While some will find the idea off-putting, Bell considers the arrangement a “win-win” for all parties, as the renters have already figured out ways to make money off their land, and the digital platform becomes more vibrant as a result of its use. He considers himself one of the good guys. “A lot of speculators aren't using the land that they're buying,” Bell said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eWhen I asked Sychov of Somnium Space to speak, his only request was that he be able to perform the interview using his virtual reality headset from inside Somnium Space, where he appeared as his NFT avatar and showed me around. Sychov proudly told me that the “whole world” he was showing me was built by users. It was a beautiful and lush environment as well. He introduced me to a few of his friends, pointed out a beautiful sunset, and took me into a virtual dance club, which had a VIP area, bathrooms, and a pole for dancers. One day later, the club would be hosting a live DJ from Las Vegas who would be spinning in VR and a woman in Belgium who would wear full-body tracking and dancing on the pole in her home and, of course, in Somnium Space. He believes the only way to truly enter the metaverse is through a virtual reality headset, not a browser. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003e“\\u003c/b\\u003eI've been in virtual worlds since 1999.

For one, land on Roblox, the platform Yorio referenced, is free to build on and limitless, unlike many new metaverse worlds, according to a spokesperson. One recent poll also found that less than 40 percent of Gen Z—people born between 1997 and 2012—believe \\\\\\\"\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/metaverse-gen-z-millennials-crypto-land-sales-investing-virtual-worlds-2021-12\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ethe metaverse is the next big thing and will become part of our lives in the next decade\\u003c/a\\u003e.” The pragmatic concerns are clear too. “The one constant in this space is delays,” said Yorio. One of the primary issues she sees is a “talent bottleneck,” estimating the industry needs to onboard “another million blockchain engineers” and “half a million 3D developers.” Other questions about the treatment of women have cropped up. (Some female beta testers and users have already registered issues with \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003egroping\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-15/being-a-woman-inside-the-metaverse-video\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eother uncomfortable situations\\u003c/a\\u003e.)\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eAnd then there is the more existential question of how many people, beyond those who stand to profit, actually want this at all.  Skeptics include Ken Kutaragi, the inventor of the PlayStation, who \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/playstation-creator-kutaragi-snubs-metaverse-and-vr-headsets?srnd=technology-vp\\u0026sref=z97LigUM\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003erecently told Bloomberg\\u003c/a\\u003e he can’t see the “point” of the metaverse.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“You would rather be a polished avatar instead of your real self?

Decentraland land that was going for an average of $1,180 per parcel last January had jumped to almost $14,100 by December, and land in The Sandbox had gone from $178 to $14,400, according to NFT data tracker NonFungible.com. Like those platforms, Somnium Space has had some people pay real money for its digital land—an average of $14,200 by the end of last year. Bell hasn’t bought as much digital land this year due to what he sees as the “high, high peak of speculation” that’s enveloped the entire technological world.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eSychov, for his part, believes such investments will have intrinsic value because users will be able to truly own the land without Somnium as an intermediary because of the blockchain. “For the first time ever, people can actually own things in a decentralized way,” he said. “They can sell the world. They can monetize it. They can rent it. And that's the revolution.” But he also believes that not all metaverse investments will pan out the same. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“Behind those prices has to be a product,” said Sychov.

Who gets to do that?” Duncan told Motherboard. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eDuncan, who is 30 and lives in Texas, became active in the energetic cryptocurrency community on Twitter early last year, when she quickly started to grow her follower count through a combination of memes and jokes. She soon figured out she could monetize her following by promoting crypto projects to her growing audience, and by October she was making enough money to quit her full-time job. Today, Duncan says she’s earning more than she’s ever made in her life, pulling in more in two months than she used to make in an entire year by creating NFT projects, performing occasional consulting work, and pumping crypto. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“It’s crazy,” she said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eOne of the companies Duncan has worked with is \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.dankbank.co/\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eDank Bank\\u003c/a\\u003e, a startup that recently raised \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/01/monetized-memes-dank-bank-raises-42069m/\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003e$4 million\\u003c/a\\u003e to develop an NFT marketplace dedicated to famous memes and viral moments. Harry Jones, the founder and CEO of Dank Bank, told Motherboard that he’s spent money on crypto promoters like Duncan because “traditional advertising just doesn't work in crypto,” as the community isn’t “interested in buying things because they saw a paid ad.” Instead, he said, potential customers are looking for advice from online influencers they already trust. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“That's why influencers are having this insane moment in Web3, because all of these projects need people to sort of buy authenticity from,” Jones said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eDuncan is just one of hundreds of people recently named on lists of purported \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkp9wg/leaked-shill-price-list-shows-wild-world-of-crypto-promos\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003epaid crypto promoters\\u003c/a\\u003e first leaked to the pseudonymous independent crypto investigator “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1516129830873583617\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eZachxbt\\u003c/a\\u003e.”  Motherboard investigated those lists and discovered a great deal about the inner workings of the thriving underworld of the online (and occasionally secretive) crypto promotion market. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eCompared to the carefully-lawyered crypto ads that dominated this year’s Super Bowl, the messy online world of crypto promotion is international in scope but hastily slapped together, filled with earnest boosters and cynical money-grabbers alike, largely wary of outside attention and at times ignorant of, or disregarding, U.S. laws. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eRecording artists have turned to hawking projects for pay; former NGO workers now spend their day coordinating crypto deals; and a growing number of people, pseudonymous or not, have otherwise figured out how to make a career out of pushing out videos, memes, and tweets promoting crypto projects for money.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eMotherboard reached out to approximately 200 influencers for this story. Most ignored us, said they weren’t interested, turned us down once they learned that we do not pay sources, or cut off communication when asked specific questions about their work. But roughly a dozen in and around the industry were willing to speak about their burgeoning industry, which has provided them with economic opportunity while also proving prone to scams and deceit. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eDo you work in the world of crypto promotion?

Some participants say they prefer to work directly with crypto projects while others go through intermediaries. Some get paid per post, others take a contract or even a salary. Some are happy to pump crypto for pay full-time while others say they do it to make a little money on the side. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eA not-insignificant percentage of the work seems automated. Numerous promoters responded to our inquiries within seconds, telling us to type “promo” or “rates” to view their price list. What exactly they were offering was confusing, even after they clarified it. One promoter listed a 24-hour Twitter “shill” rate of $100; another listed five promotion packages, ranging from a $39 “permanent post” to a $149 “weekly package” that included four “permanent” posts and eight retweets; another said they charge $160 per tweet to shill “any” NFT project. One influencer offered a “team” campaign that included 10 influencers with a total of 7 million followers for $1,500.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__media\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cpicture class=\\\\\\\"article__image\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 25em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=600:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 40.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=975:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 53.125em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=1275:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(min-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651672921470-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-100134-am.png\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 10.01.34 AM.png\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/picture\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__image-caption\\\\\\\"\\u003eA number of influencers automatically responded with promotional messages when contacted by Motherboard on Twitter.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eA cottage industry has also sprouted up around coordinating influencer campaigns for crypto projects: Rather than every project having to go out and find people willing to tweet rocket emojis on their behalf, they can go to brokers who are already plugged in to a roster of influencers.

One of them is Kyle Fortch, a Canadian recording artist who was inspired to enter the crypto world last May, after Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy announced in a mock college signing press conference that he had decided to push the crypto project SafeMoon. (Portnoy has \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/barstool-dave-portnoy-bitcoin-crypto-too-big-to-fail\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003esince described SafeMoon\\u003c/a\\u003e as his \\\\\\\"worst purchase.\\\\\\\") \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“I thought it was hilarious,” said Fortch. He and his friend, a professional hockey player, ​​decided to invest and join the crypto community. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBy summer, when the crypto market was truly booming, demand for influencers like Fortch was “huge,” he said, and soon enough, people were reaching out with opportunities to make money promoting their crypto projects. “No matter where you were on the influencer scale or celebrity scale, there was something for you to do,” said Fortch. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eUnlike many of his peers, Fortch decided to take payment only in the form of flat fees rather than requesting some of the crypto project’s tokens, which he says is common in crypto promotion circles. Indeed, many projects earmark a portion of the pot of tokens for marketing. Taking tokens could prove financially lucrative if the price rockets up, but Fortch deduced it came with reputational risk as well. Should the founders “rug”—crypto-speak for disappearing with investors’ money—and his followers accuse Fortch of promoting a scheme for personal profit, he could say, “No, I didn't. I wasn't even a holder” of the token, he told Motherboard. Plus, he likes to know the amount he’s getting paid, regardless of how the project performs. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eFortch has also experienced the issues with the online promotion market from the other side of the equation. Recently, he was working on a “decentralized crypto fundraising tool,” which he compared to GoFundMe for the “crypto space,” that signed and paid a marketing team to perform duties including “DM Twitter blasts.” Soon after, the marketing team ran off with the money without ever performing any work, he said. Fortch said that he now does significant due diligence before signing on with a company, so he can be confident the project leaders are not going to “use” him “as a promoter for a pump-and-dump” scheme and then disappear. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“That makes me look bad,” he said. In a world of scammers, Fortch said he appreciates Dapp Centre and considers them “one of the more trustworthy” partners, vetting clients and providing tweet templates. “It's more so being a partner with Dapp Centre than it is being a partner with the project,” Fortch said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eNigerian influencer Udeme William has taken on broader roles in the crypto ecosystem, transforming his promotional work into a multifaceted influencer-coordination career. He has worked as a “middleman” between crypto projects and Dapp Centre in the past, he said, providing scripts, pictures, and information to the company, which then promotes the project on YouTube.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBefore William was a crypto promoter, he had worked at a health NGO in Nigeria, where he made only $200-300 every month, he said. Due to rising inflation, the salary sometimes didn’t even cover the bare necessities of food, transport, and housing, and he needed to take out high-interest loans in order to get by. Frustrated, he began to dabble in cryptocurrency and soon became entranced. He started to tell his friends and family members about his new passion for crypto, and he opened a Twitter account to convince others to get in too, where he gained a following. Even the CEO and founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, followed him.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut William realized he couldn’t rely on his crypto investments alone to sustain him financially. “Just buying and holding a coin cannot give you the kind of money you need to take care of your daily expenses,” he said. So when he started to receive offers to get paid for his tweets, he jumped at the opportunity. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eOver time, he transitioned into coordinating influencers. He said he takes a salary from the African NFT company AFEN and works on a contractual basis with Nabox, a \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://twitter.com/naboxwallet\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003e“Multi-Chain DID Gateway to Web3\\u003c/a\\u003e,” according to the company’s Twitter page. Often, his work involves bringing exposure and potential investors to a project, in part by paying other influencers to “tweet daily” about a given project, as well as push it on other social media platforms. The lump sum he receives from Nabox is used to pay influencers and he keeps the rest, he said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBri, a U.S.-based crypto influencer who goes by “Crypto Bri,” appeared on Dapp Centre’s list but did not not remember working with the company. She said the prices she charges were much lower than what was listed, but that wasn’t too surprising to her. Marketing agencies acting as crypto promotion middlemen sometimes reach out for her rates and then find clients who will pay an even higher price in order for them to bank the difference, she said.  \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“They typically have a ton of content creators in their network,” Bri said of middlemen generally in the crypto promotion industry. “If a NFT/Crypto client is looking for two weeks of coverage, they go to an agency most of the time. That agency will organize the marketing for the client. In the process, they pay me my usual rate for a tweet, then charge 2x-3x to the client.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBri said she believes the arrangement benefits all parties, as crypto projects don’t have to find, contact, and strike an arrangement with individual influencers, and the influencers get a payment they might not have received otherwise. “Ultimately though,” she said, “it's always much cheaper to go to the content creators personally.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eJones, the CEO of Dank Bank, doesn’t like to work with middlemen promising blanketed promotional campaigns by influencers, which he sees as “super inauthentic” and ineffective. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“It's gotta look genuine. It’s gotta actually be genuine,” he said. He instead prefers to work directly with influencers, sometimes giving them license to do whatever “they think is gonna hit” with their following and sometimes working carefully to “tailor the messaging depending on who the influencer is.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eKyle Fortch, the Canadian recording artist, tries hard to toe the difficult line between outward authenticity and adequate financial disclosure. Members of the TikTok generation “really hate shit being forced down” their throats, he said, so many crypto companies ask him to write and talk in his own words so that it sounds “less like it's a commercial” (others provide templates).\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eTo Fortch, his primary responsibility as a paid influencer is to remind his followers that his promotional posts are opinion-based and “not financial advice” and that they should do their own research—statements he commonly affixes to his paid posts in hashtag form, he said. Considering the industry’s propensity for scams, Fortch said that message is arguably even more critical than disclosing that he has been paid for his post. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“You have to be diligent and let them know, ‘Hey, I'm not telling you to invest in such and such. I'm just outlining this token’s details basically—like their market cap, yada, yada, yada,’” he said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eCompared with the traditional corporate world, filled as it is with lawyers tasked with ensuring compliance with advertising laws, the piecemeal crypto promotion market more often sees the law as open to interpretation by the individual. That’s been a source of frustration to Duncan, the Texan influencer, who told Motherboard that it’s “unfortunately” very “common” for crypto influencers not to properly disclose they are getting paid for their posts. Duncan herself always tries to clearly disclose when she’s been paid to post online content, and it’s confusing to her why someone would try to hide they were paid. “It just doesn't make sense to me,” she said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eFalling to disclose a promotion is technically against the law. Influencers who do not state their financial relationship with a company or marketer when shilling a crypto product could be violating the Federal Trade Commission Act, according to Juliana Gruenwald Henderson, a spokesperson focusing on technology issues at the FTC.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“The general principle is that if there’s a connection between an endorser and a marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed,” Gruenwald Henderson wrote over email.

Paid YouTube or TikTok influencers must similarly include a disclosure in the video in which they’re promoting the product, and throughout the video if it goes on for a while, rather than just plopping a note in the accompanying description. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThat is especially true if the crypto company is based in the U.S., but it also goes if Americans could be influenced by the promotion, according to David Klein, a managing partner at Klein Moynihan Turco focused on internet marketing and advertising law. The FTC’s law applies regardless of the size of the company, type of industry, or even the character limit of the social media platform used for promotion, he said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__media\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cpicture class=\\\\\\\"article__image\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 25em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=600:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 40.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=975:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 53.125em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=1275:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(min-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651673060061-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-92418-am.png\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 9.24.18 AM.png\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/picture\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__image-caption\\\\\\\"\\u003eOne crypto influencer, who shared this information prices with Motherboard, said \\\\\\\"it's understood that every post on [their] page are paid promotions.\\\\\\\"\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“If you are promoting a product or service—or, in this case, a cryptocurrency—you have to disclose that it's a promotional tweet,” Klein said. “Short of doing that, both the influencer who's posting a tweet and the cryptocurrency company that is compensating the influencer for posting the tweet are both in the regulatory crosshairs of the FTC.” That goes for the entities acting as middlemen as well. “Everyone in the chain is responsible,” he said.  \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eWhatever the arrangement, the involved parties should sign written agreements to comply with the \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eFTC’s product endorsement guidelines\\u003c/a\\u003e and so-called \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-issues-guidelines-internet-advertising/0005dotcomstaffreport.pdf\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eDot Com disclosures\\u003c/a\\u003e, according to Klein. “But that's not even enough.

But whether a federal agency would choose to target individual influencers for an illegal lack of disclosure is less clear. As BuzzFeed recently noted, the FTC has traditionally targeted the companies that pay influencers and limited their interaction with influencers to “threatening” letters, like the \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/ftc-cracks-down-harder-on-celebrity-instagram-ads\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eones sent out to Instagram influencers\\u003c/a\\u003e in 2017. If an international influencer is hawking an international crypto project, and an American influencer gets duped, it is, at a minimum, less likely the FTC or SEC would spend time building a case against them. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eRegardless, the rules do not appear clear to some influencers who have stumbled into a following and an income source. While many of the influencers Motherboard spoke with said they work hard to disclose their promotions, a crypto influencer in the United Kingdom admitted that he doesn’t disclose when he is paid for promotional posts unless explicitly asked to do so. (He does try to vet the companies that pay him, he said.)\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eA Filipino influencer listed in the spreadsheets, who confirmed past work with Dapp Centre, said that when it comes to disclosure, it’s simply “understood that every post” on her page is a paid promotion. And a French influencer who has worked with Dapp Centre said that while she tries to remember to add proper disclosures, she “forget[s] sometimes” and then adds the disclosure in a follow-up tweet. One crypto influencer who was listed in the spreadsheets but said she didn’t know of Dapp Centre said she tries to include the hashtag #AD but makes sure only to include factual information, rather than saying an investment will increase by “100x.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe FTC isn’t the only federal agency concerned with disclosure. The SEC in fact requires another step. Influencers promoting cryptocurrencies or virtual tokens that could later be deemed a security must disclose not only the fact that they are being paid but also the amount \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.crowdcheck.com/sites/default/files/17%28b%29%20best%20practices_0.pdf\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ethey received\\u003c/a\\u003e. “Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,” \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-potentially-unlawful-promotion-icos\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ethe SEC wrote\\u003c/a\\u003e in 2017. “A failure to disclose this information is a violation of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe agency has made good on its threats in the past, \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003echarging Floyd Mayweather Jr. and DJ Khaled\\u003c/a\\u003e in 2018 after the celebrities failed to disclose payments received while pumping Initial Coin Offerings that the federal agency deemed to be unregistered securities. In 2020, the SEC similarly charged the deceased computer programmer John McAfee with promoting crypto investments on Twitter “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-246\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ewithout disclosing that he was paid to do so\\u003c/a\\u003e.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut the SEC has also gone after much smaller personalities than McAfee and could this time as well, according to Max Dilendorf, a lawyer specializing in digital assets and cryptocurrencies. “Actually, it's a lot easier to go after small influencers,” Dilendorf said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe issue becomes even more legally thorny for influencers who are pushing cryptocurrencies that could later be categorized as unregistered securities, according to Dilendorf. In such cases, “even if you made disclosures, you still cannot do it because you are selling unregistered securities, which is illegal on its own,” Dilendorf told Motherboard. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eWhile Fortch sometimes includes the hashtag “AD” in his posts, he didn’t see it as required, telling Motherboard that “from a legal standpoint, all you have to basically mention is that you're not a financial adviser, you're not giving advice, that it’s basically an opinion,” even if he is paid to post something. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__media\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cpicture class=\\\\\\\"article__image\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 25em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=600:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 40.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=975:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 53.125em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=1275:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(min-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1651678583541-screen-shot-2022-05-04-at-104326-am.png\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 10.43.26 AM.png\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/picture\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__image-caption\\\\\\\"\\u003eCrypto promoter Ashley Duncan always tries to clearly disclose when she’s been paid to post online content, and it’s confusing to her why someone would try to hide they were paid. \\\\\\\"It just doesn't make sense to me,” she said. (Source: Twitter)\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eKlein, the lawyer, disagrees. “That doesn't have anything to do with disclosing that you're being compensated to post a post,” Klein said when presented with the argument. Fortch took issue with the lawyer’s interpretation in a direct message over Twitter on Friday. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“It doesn’t really matter what those ‘experts’ think or how they feel in a legal standpoint,” he wrote. “All promoters have to do is tell their following or community this is an opinion-based post, not advice. You can also add that this is a paid promotion [sic].” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut Fortch believes the argument over disclosure gets in the way of a larger issue about just how much potential crypto investors should be listening to crypto promoters like himself.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“They shouldn't be relying on calls from influencers,” he then added. “That would be silly without doing their own research.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eEarly on, like many other influencers in her new industry, Ashley Duncan was often charging her clients for every individual post and retweet. As long as she included a proper disclosure, she didn’t see a problem with that. But her attitude toward charging for every action has changed with time. Paid retweets, in particular, now concern her, and she now mostly turns down such offers, which are common in the industry. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“It just doesn't feel right,” she said. “You can't tell if somebody's being paid to retweet it or not. And despite it just being a retweet, it still has an impact.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eKlein said that he didn’t see why the rules around paid retweets would be “any different.” (“But for the compensation, you wouldn't be retweeting it,” Klein said.) Duncan will now only post a paid retweet if she’s disclosed the partnership elsewhere, she said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eAs Duncan learned about the industry’s issues with scams, her broader approach to crypto promotion has changed as well. She’s now more careful about who she works with and tries to find long-term fits where she can establish trust with the project. “This is a dream scenario,” she said. “Not everybody gets this opportunity, so it's not to be taken lightly.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eOthers said the same. William realized he didn’t like getting paid to dash off a one-time tweet about a project, so he now searches for jobs that will last six months to a year. Fortch is focusing on “pumping” one or two projects a month and diversifying his product offering, not simply publishing a tweet but also promoting the project with podcasts and Twitter spaces and helping with behind-the-scenes marketing. He hopes to one day blend his interests and create a “crypto music video.” “I’m trying to expand my value rather than just being a tweet,” Fortch said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eJones, the Dank Bank CEO, said he supports the shift, as he considers paying per post “strange” and “disrespectful” to influencers who have become so critical to his industry.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eWith time, Duncan has found an online community of influencers who trade opinions and otherwise work to make the space more professional and trustworthy. She doesn’t love the term “influencer” herself, though, even though she occasionally refers to herself as one. Too many people, herself included, associate the term with “grifters” and otherwise “shady people” who are “trying to squeeze the money out of their community.” She sees herself more as a part of her community than anything else. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“I hate the idea that I could influence the market in any way because I don't feel like any one person should have that power,” Duncan said. “But some people say that I have that power.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eEdward Ongweso Jr. and Jordan Pearson contributed reporting to this

Fidelity was not the first provider to offer a retirement crypto allocation.

One month earlier, Ali Khawar, the acting assistant secretary for the Employee Benefits Security Administration, which is tasked with regulating company-sponsored retirement plans, had released \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20220310\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ecompliance assistance\\u003c/a\\u003e stating he had “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://blog.dol.gov/2022/03/10/cryptocurrency-concerns-why-were-working-to-protect-retirement-savings-from-volatile-digital-investments\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eserious concerns\\u003c/a\\u003e” about any inclusion of cryptocurrencies in U.S. retirement plans and urging plan providers to “exercise extreme care before” they did so. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__blockquote\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003e\\u003cb\\u003eDo you work at Fidelity?

In 2019, according to the Labor Department, roughly 91 million Americans had a combined $6.2 trillion in 401(k) plans. The system allows employees to put pre-tax income into an investment vehicle—sometimes receiving a match by employers—while proportionally lowering their taxable income (along with other benefits).\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe entrance of Bitcoin into the retirement ecosystem represented “a significant departure from current standard practices in more ways than one,” said Sean Smith, an investment manager based in Minneapolis who often reviews clients’ 401(k) plans. Typically, he said, 401(k) plans tend not to offer either alternative “store of value” assets, like gold, or non-U.S. currencies, like Euros—two types of asset classes commonly compared to cryptocurrencies. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe system is “all built on a foundation of trust,” Khawar said, meaning that people needed to feel that their money is in safe hands and would rise in value with time and consistent contributions. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut with Fidelity’s decision to integrate cryptocurrencies into the American retirement system, Khawar had reason to believe that foundation was weakening. Due to the billions of dollars in tax breaks the U.S. government dedicates to propping up the 401(k) retirement system, the decision could be seen as a \\u003ci\\u003ede facto\\u003c/i\\u003e subsidy to early Bitcoin holders, who could stumble upon a new hoard of people willing to buy into the crypto casino. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eAt a minimum, it was a significant bet by an American institution on a highly volatile asset class that cannot be evaluated with traditional valuation metrics—one that some believe could lead to a rash of lawsuits.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eFidelity’s decision to include Bitcoin in its retirement offering had been motivated in part by a “growing interest from plan sponsors in providing access to digital assets in defined contribution plans” and “growing demand among their employees,” particularly young employees, a Fidelity spokesperson told Motherboard over email. Broadly speaking, there’s no doubting how Millennials and Generation Z have embraced crypto. One survey spearheaded by Investopedia and released in April found that as many as one-quarter of millennials are now “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/investopedia-survey-finds-1-in-4-millennials-now-using-crypto-to-fund-retirement-301516726.html\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003erelying on crypto to help fund their retirement\\u003c/a\\u003e.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut Fidelity’s decision to bet American retirement accounts on the Bitcoin market was not simply a result of consumer demand. “It’s a natural extension of their efforts over the past decade,” said Andy Boyd, Fidelity’s former head of global equity capital markets. For much of the past decade, the historically sleepy retirement giant has steadily transformed into one of the loudest institutional advocates for the crypto industry. Leading the charge has been company CEO Abigail Johnson.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eJohnson wields even more significant power at Fidelity than the typical CEO.

At a rare public speech during a New York blockchain conference in 2017, Johnson came out as a true “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-ceo-bringing-blockchain-to-the-masses-harder-than-it-seemed-1495548000\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ebeliever\\u003c/a\\u003e” in the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, bragging that one of her computers had “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.ft.com/content/876ec06c-3f46-11e7-9d56-25f963e998b2\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003emined over 200,000 satoshis\\u003c/a\\u003e,” a denomination of Bitcoin, and sporting a pin that read “Vote Nakamoto President,” a reference to Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“Some of you might be wondering why I’m here today.

By 2017, Fidelity was \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fidelity-investments-bitcoin/fidelity-allows-clients-to-see-digital-currencies-on-its-website-idUSKBN1AP0AO\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eallowing clients\\u003c/a\\u003e to connect their Coinbase accounts. The next year, the company created Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary focused on crypto. “Our goal is to make digitally native assets, such as Bitcoin, more accessible to investors,” Johnson said then. Last year, Fidelity pushed further into the crypto world, announcing plans to increase \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/fidelity-digital-to-expand-staff-by-70-on-strong-crypto-demand?sref=z97LigUM\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ethe size of its Digital Assets staff by 70 percent\\u003c/a\\u003e and offer crypto trading beyond typical trading hours.

Vanguard, one of the country’s other largest 401(k) providers, for one, has taken a wholly skeptical view of crypto, \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003estating last September\\u003c/a\\u003e that it believed “the long-term investment case” for cryptocurrencies to be “weak,” since they simultaneously are “highly speculative” and “don’t offer any intrinsic value for the sizable amount of risk the investor takes on.” A spokesperson confirmed to Motherboard that Vanguard has “no plans to offer a cryptocurrency option within 401(k) plans.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eAs a result of the industry-wide mistrust of crypto, Fidelity’s Bitcoin offering could give the firm a “competitive advantage” as more young employees ask employers to include crypto in their retirement portfolios, said Hougan. Boyd similarly said the Bitcoin offering gave Fidelity an “interesting edge” as the baby boomer generation begins to pull out its assets and Fidelity battles with the other 401(k) giants to win over the younger generation.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“There's a lot of interest in particular with the younger generation, which they fight tooth and nail for,” said Boyd. “They want the people that are going into the prime of their working years.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eAli Khawar, the acting assistant secretary for the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, started to worry about the potential inclusion of cryptocurrencies in U.S. retirement plans in the first half of last year, when the Department of Labor first heard about service providers pressuring employers to include crypto in their offerings. “They were actively and somewhat aggressively encouraging employers to adopt this within the context of the 401(k),” Khawar told Motherboard.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eTo better understand the idea, representatives of the Labor Department had a series of conversations both internally and with “external stakeholders,” Khawar said. He worried about the highly volatile nature of crypto, the lack of clear valuation metrics, and the ambiguous regulatory environment. But the Department wanted to know if crypto proponents had constructive answers to his questions. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“When we've asked the folks marketing these things how they go about valuing it or how we should think about that, the answers were pretty unsatisfying” a senior Labor Department official who requested anonymity told Motherboard. Khawar agreed. “We were not convinced, as a result of those conversations, that the kinds of issues we highlighted in the guidance weren’t problems,” he said. “They haven't really given us an explanation of what exactly the valuation methodology is, how it actually works, [or] what any of the cryptocurrencies are intrinsically.” Some have compared it to gold, but that reasoning didn’t satisfy Khawar, as gold can be made into jewelry or any number of products.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eInstead, Khawar came to view cryptocurrency as more of “a self-fulfilling prophecy” than anything else. The torrent of celebrity-led crypto endorsements, including during this year’s Super Bowl, partly inspired Khawar to start developing a counternarrative for employers to consider. The rhetoric surrounding crypto reminded him of the lead up to the mortgage crisis, he said, when people didn’t fully understand the investments they were making, only believing them to be a sure thing. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“That psychological messaging can be really powerful. It's powerful to individuals that are thinking about how they're gonna save for retirement. But it's also powerful for those fiduciaries,” Khawar said. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__media\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cpicture class=\\\\\\\"article__image\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 25em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=600:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 40.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=975:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 53.125em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=1275:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(max-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003csource media=\\\\\\\"(min-width: 65.625em)\\\\\\\" srcset=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png?resize=1575:* 2x\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\\\\\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1652215963638-screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-45211-pm.png\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"Screen Shot 2022-05-10 at 4.52.11 PM.png\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/picture\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\\\"article__image-caption\\\\\\\"\\u003eFrom early on in Johnson's new role as CEO of Fidelity, it was clear she had become fascinated by the world of crypto. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eIn March, the Labor Department released its guidance, which concluded that integrating cryptocurrencies into retirement accounts presented “\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/compliance-assistance-releases/2022-01\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003esignificant risks of fraud, theft, and loss\\u003c/a\\u003e.” Among the concerns were crypto’s volatility and lack of “academically defensible” valuation metrics; scammers’ tendency to pump and dump crypto assets with “misleading information”; and a lack of clear regulatory guidelines. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut Khawar went a step further. Adding crypto to a 401(k) offering, he said, would lend legitimacy to an industry that is thus far unwarranted. “When fiduciaries include a cryptocurrency option on a 401(k) plan menu, it signals to participants that knowledgeable investment experts have approved it as a prudent option,” Khawar wrote at the time. “This can mislead participants about the risks and cause big losses.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eOne month later, Fidelity ignored the guidance and released news of its forthcoming 401(k) Bitcoin offering.

Less than a year earlier, a much smaller 401(k) provider had made national headlines when it announced it would allow participants to allocate \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/this-small-401k-provider-wants-to-bring-cryptocurrency-to-americans-retirement-funds.html\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003e5 percent of their retirement savings\\u003c/a\\u003e into 50 different crypto assets. Now, the country’s king of 401(k)s had allowed a 20 percent allocation into just one: Bitcoin, which has recently lost half its value from just a few months earlier. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eFidelity told Motherboard that the 20 percent cap was “designed to enhance consumer protection” in consultation with employers and emphasized that sponsors could impose lower caps should they wish to do so.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“Given this is a new investment vehicle, requiring that plan sponsors establish a cap for participants to contribute or exchange is intended to further enhance our consumer protection efforts,” a spokesperson wrote in an email.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eBut Khawar and other legal experts said even that percentage was too high.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“It's a lot because it's not just cryptocurrency. It’s one particular type of cryptocurrency,” Khawar said, adding that’s “not the kind of diversification advice that you would typically get from a financial advisor.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eHilary Allen’s heart sank when she heard news of Fidelity’s decision, she said.  Allen is a law professor who studies financial regulation at American University and recently published a paper comparing the spate of financial innovations to come out of crypto to the tools that led to \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4038788\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ethe 2008 financial crisis\\u003c/a\\u003e. She had been previously heartened by the Labor Department’s guidance, which she saw as a win for investor protections. But in Fidelity’s decision, all she could see was the pain such a decision could cause.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eStill, Allen said the Department of Labor’s guidance provided employees with a future “roadmap” to sue over 401(k) losses related to crypto offerings. “It really does suggest that it is a violation of fiduciary duties to be including these types of assets in a plan,” said Allen.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eUnder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, often referred to as ERISA, employers are required by law to “act solely in the financial interests of plan participants,” according to the Department of Labor,  a significant enough legal obligation that Khawar feels comfortable entrusting them with future decisions.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eTo Ted Benna, that makes sense. Benna has been referred to as the “father of the 401(k)” since the 1980s, when he figured out employers could match employees’ pre-tax retirement contributions under a new law, a revelation that led to an explosion of interest in the retirement plan.  \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“ERISA requires employers to act solely in the best interest of their participants, and I don’t think employers that throw this in their plan are doing that,” said Benna, an admitted crypto skeptic. “They blow that responsibility if they simply respond to some pressure from participants.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eMichael Saylor, the prominent Bitcoin devotee CEO of the enterprise analytics firm MicroStrategy, has said he hoped to become the first public company to offer Fidelity’s Bitcoin-infused 401(k) plan to employees. But most other employers so far appear to be scared off from the world of crypto. The Plan Sponsor Council of America, a nonprofit trade organization focused on retirement plans, recently performed a survey of its member organizations and found less than 2 percent were considering adding crypto to their investment options. “Plan sponsors are overwhelmingly not considering, and will not consider, cryptocurrency a prudent investment option in a retirement plan,” the nonprofit stated.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eShould Fidelity’s option catch fire anyway, one of the biggest winners will likely be not the people who invest through Fidelity, but those who already own Bitcoin, said Hougan. As he explained, opening up “more of the market to potential investment for crypto has historically been good for crypto prices over the long term and therefore good for crypto investors.” Turned around, however, that same line of thinking could be viewed as more concerning. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“A lot of the profits to be made out of crypto have already been made by the people who were early adopters,” said Allen. “There may be something left for people who are getting in now. But that is only if they can find someone to get in after them.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe traditional rationale for investment is to put money toward productive economic use, like providing jobs to people who build a product, which then produces an ongoing flow of money that benefits investors over time. By comparison, assets with “no tangible value” that are “only worth what someone else is willing to pay you” for them must by their nature constantly find more investors to sustain themselves, Allen said. As a result, Allen sees Fidelity’s decision as “really problematic.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“They've opened up a pool of new investors through the 401(k) plan, which can prop up and support earlier investors,” Allen added. “But who's gonna come in next?”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eAllen’s perspective is shared by some people within the Labor Department. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“There's reason to be concerned that the main thing motivating the purchases are that other people are buying it, and the hope that after you buy it, when it comes time to sell, you'll be able to sell it to other people who are buying it,” a senior department official said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eGuglielmetti, the Brooklyn financial planner, described many of her clients as “crypto curious.” Considering the complicated tax implications of crypto, she can understand the desire to sidestep the tax questions by investing through a retirement vehicle like a 401(k). Should those tax benefits convince a new slew of people to enter the crypto sphere, Fidelity’s offering could come to be seen as a taxpayer-led subsidy of early Bitcoin holders, who will have found a new crop of investors to sell to.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eContributions to a 401(k) are deducted from an individual’s total taxable income, a substantial tax benefit for those who aggressively save for retirement. As of last year, the U.S. government dedicated \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-largest-tax-expenditures\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003e$157 billion\\u003c/a\\u003e in so-called tax expenditures—or money the government doesn’t get because of tax breaks—to propping up employer-defined contributions like 401(k)s, more than any other area besides employer-sponsored health insurance and reduced rates on capital-gains tax, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe Labor Department believes that the institutions, like Fidelity, who indirectly benefit from that subsidy should subsequently be held to a higher standard than the typical investment fund.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“The taxpayer is in a sense subsidizing the retirement marketplace, and the people playing in that marketplace in exchange for that should expect to have some additional obligations,” said the senior department official.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eIn the last six months, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has experienced a dramatic moment of turbulence. Bitcoin has lost half of its value. So has Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency. Numerous others have fared worse. This isn't even a unique situation; dramatic crashes are a familiar recurring event in cryptocurrency's brief history. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe Fidelity spokesperson described the response from plan sponsors as “positive” and said that the company continues to believe that “digital assets will represent a large part of the financial industry’s future.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eConsidering the lack of understanding surrounding crypto fluctuations, many other people appear more nervous about Bitcoin’s oncoming entrance into the retirement system. Khawar, for one, isn’t advocating against investing any money in cryptocurrency, only that which people hope will one day fund their retirement.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\\\\\\"This is different than just your brokerage account,” he said. \\\\\\\"The law treats it differently. It's just a different animal.\\\\\\\" \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eGuglielmetti similarly worries a Bitcoin offering might be “incompatible with what a 401(k) is trying to do.” Hougan cautioned against all workers investing too much of their retirement in Bitcoin as well, though he also described the Fidelity news as a “win for investors” and “a step in generally the right direction.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe prospect makes Boyd, the former Fidelity employee, nervous too. He worries that unsophisticated investors will buy into the hype and crank the Bitcoin-retirement spigot as high as they can go. “It just doesn't seem to fit with what a 401(k) is all about,” Boyd said. “Technically, it’s an investment account, but it's really a retirement account.”   \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“You’re not supposed to be daytrading in your 401(k). This is the money that is going to help you survive when you stop working so society doesn’t need to do it,” Boyd added. “Why would you put a highly volatile asset into a 401(k)? Into a retirement plan?”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\\",\\\"__using_components\\\":false,\\\"suggested_tweet\\\":null,\\\"dek\\\":\\\"The retirement giant and its crypto-loving CEO are pushing Bitcoin into their

In it, Wood stated that a core tenet of the web’s next generation would be privacy, including encrypted communication through “identity-based” pseudonyms. \\\\\\\"Information that we assume to be public, we publish. Information we assume to be agreed upon, we place on a consensus ledger. Information that we assume to be private, we keep secret and never reveal,\\\\\\\" he wrote.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eSuch a claim was of a piece with the ideas of the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin and has never revealed their identity. But Edward Snowden’s leaks about the true scope and power of the U.S. surveillance state made it even more clear to Wood that “no government or organization can reasonably be trusted.” In an interview with \\u003ci\\u003eWired\\u003c/i\\u003e late last year, \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eWood said his vision boiled down\\u003c/a\\u003e to “less trust, more truth.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__pull-quote\\\\\\\"\\u003e“What we have to do is activate the web3 community to become a vital source of money, media and votes so that if a member of Congress takes a negative approach, then they pay a price at the polls.” - Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e“I have a particular meaning of trust that’s essentially faith.

Yet the fact that Facebook transformed in a few short years from a way for college students to share party photos to an election-altering juggernaut should provide evidence of the counterpoint: Popular but seemingly trivial internet enterprises can quickly become something much different. Chris Dixon, a partner at a16z and one of web3’s most ardent evangelists, has said as much in the past, \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003ewriting over a decade ago\\u003c/a\\u003e that “the next big thing always starts out being dismissed as a ‘toy.’” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe question then is when, exactly, public due diligence of organizations should begin: Now, or after the consequences of their creation are clear and unavoidable for all of us?\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__text--dropcap\\\\\\\"\\u003eThe controversy over Notopoulos's reporting and the ways in which it’s been expressed have the contours of a battle in a cultural war. The rhetoric, the threats against a female reporter, and the general tone of grievance from a group of people who feel besieged even as society is reordering itself around their whims are all reminiscent of Gamergate, and the many reactionary tendencies in which it culminated. There are real and obvious differences; to compare isn’t to equate. A key similarity, though, is that web3 can be defined the same way \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\"\\u003eDeadspin’s Kyle Wagner\\u003c/a\\u003e defined Gamergate, in a 2014 essay, as, by design, “nearly impossible to define”—so much so that “any discussion of this subject” turns “into a debate over semantics.” \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eA little over a week later, the reaction to the BuzzFeed story feels like the opening salvo of a new chapter in the battle over internet anonymity, which has long had to do with relatively arcane topics like government attempts to kill end-to-end encryption but is now breaking out into more fundamental questions about where the right to conceal one’s identity ends, and why. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp class=\\\\\\\"article__pull-quote\\\\\\\"\\u003e“The next big thing always starts out being dismissed as a ‘toy.’” - Chris Dixon, a partner at the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eThe idea that it doesn’t end, ever, isn’t incidental to web3, but absolutely central, and will probably become more so as more pseudonymous founders nab hundreds of millions in funding and revenue. (As Notopoulos herself pointed out in her story, “It’s possible that pseudonymous companies could become our new reality.”) Yuga Labs offers a blueprint of where the internet economy is headed—a world of decentralized autonomous organizations and NFTs and cryptocurrencies in which people cannot be certain who benefits or what anyone’s true motivations are.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eweb3 boosters say such pseudonymity is valuable.

One of the issues with a pseudonymity-prizing tech regime, though, is that it is difficult to discern whether such a system improves or perpetuates societal issues. Another is that it can undeniably serve powerful people who simply don’t want anyone to be able to tell what they’re doing. \\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eIt’s also worth wondering what perceived threat caused people to lash out at Notopoulos.

Some proponents of crypto get \\u003ci\\u003eenormously\\u003c/i\\u003e angry with those who so much as question the technology, much less criticize it, and I've been told on more than a few occasions that it's not okay for me to express my skepticism or opinions,” White said.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eLike many of web3’s loudest advocates, White can appreciate the value of internet anonymity and privacy. “[T]here are lots of very good and noble reasons people might want to stay anonymous: people living under oppressive governments, whistleblowers, journalists and researchers exposing extremists, for example,” White wrote. “I'm not sure if I'd put ‘want to run a multi-million dollar company without any accountability’ on that list. I am surprised that so many in the crypto space are so fiercely protective of the anonymity of the people behind these huge, multi-million dollar projects, especially when a lot of the reasons that people involved with them have chosen to be anonymous have turned out to be really shady.”\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cdiv style=\\\\\\\"max-width:550px\\\\\\\" data-iframely-id=\\\\\\\"pVAZQjf\\\\\\\" data-embedded-url=\\\\\\\"https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1491262459155730435\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cdiv style=\\\\\\\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:100%\\\\\\\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003ciframe src=\\\\\\\"https://oembed.vice.com/pVAZQjf?v=1\\u0026lazy=1\\u0026app=1\\u0026img=1\\u0026playerjs=1\\\\\\\" style=\\\\\\\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\\\\\\\" allowfullscreen data-iframely-smart-iframe=\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\" frameborder=\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eSelkis has positioned himself as one such protector, a particular sort of anti-“cancel culture” free speech advocate who mostly defends those on his side.

What matters to investors is that Web3 is the hot new thing and the entrepreneurs are piling in. One venture capitalist, Hadley Harris, told me that roughly half the Web3 pitches he’d recently looked over came from founders who weren’t even in the space half a year ago. That’s a claim backed up by Alchemy, a company that considers itself the Web3 infrastructural equivalent of Amazon Web Services; <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com//blog/alchemy-equity-investment\" target=\"_blank\">it said in February</a> that “hundreds of established Web2 companies” are pivoting into Web3 using its platform. Even new pharmaceutical companies are now taking a Web3 “crypto-first approach,” with <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bolts-breslow-teams-with-psychedelics-founder-on-crypto-pharma-startup?rc=l4apma\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> raising the possibility of issuing a “cryptocurrency token to participants in its clinical trials.”</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>&nbsp;“A lot of people are trying to get in on it, and a lot of people are more afraid of <em>not</em> getting in.”</p></blockquote><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The pace of the pivots can feel almost frenetic. One Ottawa-based entrepreneur, worried the world was passing him by, surprised his employees on a company Zoom call by saying he was pivoting the entire company into Web3. “I said, ‘Guys, this is the future and this is where everything is going,’” he said. “‘If we miss this boat, I don't think we can ever get back on.’” (The company, which had been a print-on-demand platform, now helps creators build 3D NFTs to sell to fans in the metaverse.)</p></span></p></div><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Like a lot of his fellow entrepreneurs, Nick Gerard, the CEO and co- founder of Norby, a startup focused on the creator economy,&nbsp; started to notice last year that one by one, his competitors were also diving headfirst into the world of crypto and Web3. Gerard said potential investors in Norby were pushing him to take the Web3 leap as well.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But Gerard couldn’t help but feel confused by the whole thing. His customers, the people he thought mattered most, rarely showed much interest in Web3 technologies at all. “I can count on one hand the number of times I have actually heard ‘NFTs’ come out of one of these people's mouths,” he told me. Even still, he and the rest of his team mulled over whether to make the switch, fearful that they were missing something everyone else could see.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“Nobody wants to be Paul Krugman,” Gerard said, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-internet-quote-2013-12\" target=\"_blank\">referring to an infamous 1998 quote</a> in which the Nobel Prize–winning economist predicted that the internet would ultimately become no more consequential than the fax machine. (He's also famously anti-Bitcoin and crypto.)</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p><em><strong>Have you worked or invested in Web3? We want to hear from you.

In the first three months of the year, the top 15 venture firms poured more money into Web3 and DeFi early- and seed-stage deals than any other area, the third straight quarter they have done so, according to <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2022-emerging-tech-indicator?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=etr_market_update&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=daily_pitch&amp;utm_content=q1_2022_emerging_tech_indicator\" target=\"_blank\">the research firm Pitchbook</a>. In total, the early- and seed-stage Web3 world nabbed $2 billion from top firms last quarter, more than double what the next-highest sector, biotechnology, received, and triple what traditional fintech got. Those figures understate the total level of interest—and money—in the space. Blockchain companies have raised at least $9.5 billion after receiving $18 billion in funding in 2021, according to numbers the research firm CrunchBase provided to Motherboard. And more firepower is on the way. In late May, amid plunging crypto prices, one of Web3’s biggest institutional backers, the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, announced it had raised a monstrous <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-fund-four/\" target=\"_blank\">$4.5 billion crypto fund</a> following a series of high-profile investments into Web3 projects like play-to-earn game <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ag/the-metaverse-has-bosses-too-meet-the-managers-of-axie-infinity\">Axie Infinity</a> and the parent company of the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvn5a/bored-apes-buzzfeed-and-the-battle-for-the-future-of-the-internet\">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>.</p></span></p></div><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“It’s a gold rush for sure,” said Dayton Mills, the co-founder and CEO of Branch. Mills’ company had been a struggling remote-work startup before he transformed it into a Web3 gaming platform. The moment he started talking about his Web3 vision, investor interest skyrocketed. “It was a tremendous difference,” he said.&nbsp; “There were people who I didn't even meet with who were just committing over email without ever even talking to me.” He had planned to raise $2 million, only to receive $20 million in commitments in two weeks. “We stopped because it just was incredibly overwhelming.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p><strong>“</strong>Something big is happening,” Mills added. “A lot of people are trying to get in on it, and a lot of people are more afraid of <em>not</em> getting in.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>What exactly they are getting in on is harder to pin down. The term “Web3” is sometimes attributed to Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, who, in 2014, described an idealized version of the web in which the system placed no trust in organizations but near-complete trust in blockchain technology. But it didn’t enter the mainstream cultural vernacular <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=web3,web%203.0\" target=\"_blank\">until last year</a>, when it started to serve as a catchall (and, coincidentally, a venture-led rebranding) for the collection of controversial&nbsp; financial-technology products that include cryptocurrencies, blockchains, non-fungible tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations (or “DAOs”), the metaverse, and decentralized financial (or DeFi) products.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><div><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“It’s like a collective Theranos. A wildly unproven product with nobody at the helm,” one venture capitalist said.</p></blockquote><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>To some, like <a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, what ties these innovations together is that they collectively offer a theoretical vision where people have “the ability to own a piece of the internet”—for example, through the use of NFTs, which are essentially tradable proof-of-ownership receipts. In such a world, people could use and even monetize their NFTs on multiple platforms, rather than just on, say, Instagram. Such a system, boosters believe—or, at least, claim to believe—will lead to a fairer, more communal version of the web, one that will wrest control back from technological giants that have profited off people’s data and creativity, creating a world where community comes before all else. Much of the ideological rhetoric hence involves talk of using Web3 “<a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">to truly empower financial inclusion</a>” (again, Andreessen Horowitz’s words) by bringing people into the fold who have been marginalized by the traditional financial structure.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Such arguments are inarguably alluring. Very few people feel the financial and internet structures that underpin society could not be vastly improved. But they also belie the fact that professional investors do not push their money into the middle of the craps table solely in order to better the world. As Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University, succinctly put it: “The reason why venture capitalists are pushing all of this is to make money.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>And in Web3, the venture class and other professional investors have found a uniquely appealing set of circumstances they believe will allow them to make a giant pile of money that does not rely on vast leaps in virtual reality or haptics technology—sometimes by pulling off an impressive degree of regulatory arbitrage, other times by taking advantage of a wholly new kind of internet marketplace.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“If there is any innovation in crypto assets, it’s not in software engineering but in financial engineering,” the London-based software engineer and crypto critic Stephen Diehl has written.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Allen, who studies financial regulation, sees the rhetoric around empowerment and inclusion as little more than a&nbsp; “cynical” ploy. She and others believe it masks the aspects of the Web3 apparatus that have made it appetizing to venture capitalists, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/bill-ackman-animoca-brands-back-web3-fund-eyeing-global-market?sref=z97LigUM\" target=\"_blank\">billionaires</a>, and other institutional players—so much so that they have moved aggressively to plant a foothold in spite of the industry’s unmistakable propensity for scams, fraud, and regulatory scrutiny.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Here we have a largely unregulated marketplace ripe for exploitation and stuffed full of unclear valuation metrics, arguable unregistered securities, peculiar financial products, ways to cash out, and a public-facing ideological mission statement.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Of particular fascination has been the critical role in the Web3 ecosystem of the token, a new type of financial product that regulators are still struggling to get a handle on but that venture capitalists have realized allows them to cash out quickly and handsomely even if the company never goes public (and twice over if they do). <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>It is, at least for now, close to a perfect playing field for the professional money-making class, one that is leading to pressures to pivot or die, whatever the utility.&nbsp; One entrepreneur described with great frustration that he had recently spoken to a founder at a VC mixer who was building a “decentralized” dinner reservation system. When he asked why a reservation system needed to be on the blockchain, the founder simply said: “It’s the future.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>It’s at least possible that Web3 could bring about a better, more fulfilling version of the internet. It’s just as likely, though, to prove to be what its harshest critics fear: a “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-cryptocurrencies-and-web3-are-multilevel-marketing-schemes-for-a-new-generation-11645246824\" target=\"_blank\">hyper-capitalistic</a>” reframing of the web that “<a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/web3-promises-a-better-online-future-but-contains-the-seeds-of-a-dystopian-nightmare/RES177246\" target=\"_blank\">contains the seeds of a dystopian nightmare</a>.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“It’s like a collective Theranos,” one venture capitalist said. “A wildly unproven product with nobody at the helm.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>A great many Web3 entrepreneurs and investors appear sincerely passionate about their mission of creating a better version of the internet. To many of these people, Web3 is not an idyllic possibility but <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/forthcoming-crypto-fund-to-invest-in-the-future-of-web3/\" target=\"_blank\">an all-out inevitability</a>, spoken about with an almost religious fervor. “It really feels ideological to me, and it's weird, because VCs tend not to invest in ideologies,” said Phil Libin, the former co-founder and CEO of Evernote. Indeed, soon after a recent string of crypto controversies, including the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4awjd9/the-guilt-is-unbearable-ust-luna-investors-discuss-the-9999-crypto-crash\">precipitous May crash </a>of the Luna cryptocurrency and its sister “stablecoin” UST, Andreessen Horowitz said Web3 was just now entering its “golden era.” The same week, it <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88gwax/adam-neumanns-web3-startup-raises-dollar70-million-from-vcs-goddess-nature-token\">announced an investment</a> in former WeWork CEO’s Adam Neumann’s Web3 climate venture selling “Goddess Nature Tokens.”</p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Another such believer, Benjamin Cohen, who recently started a Web3-focused investment fund, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/forthcoming-crypto-fund-to-invest-in-the-future-of-web3/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20it's%20inevitable%20that,of%20Web3%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cohen%20explained.\" target=\"_blank\">told a crypto site</a> in March that it was “inevitable that blockchain technology and smart contract technology will become implemented in every single facet of our life.” That is not an isolated opinion. “Every single company that exists is going to exist in some form of Web3,” Alexander Taub, the Miami-based co-founder of the DAO-creation tool Upstream, told Motherboard in a Zoom interview. (Taub, who wore a “Just DAO It” hat, added that “the potential market size for DAOs is, like, trillions.”)</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>A lot of the believer class come across as “zealots” who are dismissive of those who question them, according to Jason Henrichs, the CEO of Alloy Labs Alliance, who has spoken to Web3 projects about potential investment (and moved forward with some). The technology writer and researcher Evgeny Morozov has gone so far as to <a href=\"https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/web3-a-map-in-search-of-territory/\" target=\"_blank\">compare them</a> to “annoying vulgar Marxists who, for all the evidence to the contrary, kept [and keep] insisting that the objective developments within capitalism favor the inevitable transition to socialism.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>On its face, their level of confidence does indeed appear odd, or at least premature. &nbsp;One January survey by <a href=\"https://www.nationalresearchgroup.com/news/how-consumers-feel-about-web3\" target=\"_blank\">the strategy firm National Research Group</a> found that only 13 percent of surveyed American adults knew what Web3 meant, and that more than half have never heard the term. A separate poll from around the same time said less than <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/metaverse-gen-z-millennials-crypto-land-sales-investing-virtual-worlds-2021-12\" target=\"_blank\">two in five members</a> of Generation Z believed “the metaverse is the next big thing and will become part of our lives in the next decade.”&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Andreessen Horowitz claims there are <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">22,400 Web3 creators</a>, and only 18,000 developers were working in crypto or Web3 by the end of 2021, according to one recent survey by Electric Capita, nothing compared to the more than <a href=\"https://tomtunguz.com/programming-languages-web3/\" target=\"_blank\">27 million developers in the world</a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Some wonder if the Web3 hype is justified at all. Libin had been initially drawn to the “beautiful” and “elegant” concepts of Web3, he said. The CEO of the startup studio All Turtles and the virtual camera application mmhmm, as well as a former VC at General Catalyst, Libin has made a career out of searching out companies that solve real problems with clear business models. But as he started hearing from more and more Web3 companies, he found himself unable to understand what benefit came from developing certain projects on the blockchain as opposed to, for example, using an internal database. When he started to challenge some of the pitches he received, he didn’t like the answers he got. Using such technologies often seemed needlessly expensive and prone to exploitation by hackers and scammers.</p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“Web3 proponents are trying to solve real problems that need solving. I just don't think that Web3 is the solution,” he said. “It doesn't make sense to me as a programmer.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The common pro-Web3 counterargument—often repeated by VCs—is that proponents are simply early, like with the internet of the 1990s. Such unbridled optimism is not novel to Web3, but instead core to the venture and technology industries’ model, according to Martin Kenney, a professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the industry. The investors’ goal is always to sell the company, and they have an incentive to target hot sectors and then aid in raising interest in them.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“Whatever the new thing is, it’s absolutely in the VC’s interest to hype it. You’d be a fool not to,” said Kenney. “So you feed it to the press. You tell everyone it's going to change the world, that it is the best thing since sliced bread, whatever it is that will convince the investors that they need to have it.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>It can be convincing, and was famously so in the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, during which time companies that added a “.com” to their name experienced a “dramatic” and “permanent” rise in valuation immediately after the rebrand, “regardless of the firm's level of involvement with the Internet,” according to a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=254052\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> on the so-called “dotcom” effect. The researchers determined this so-called “dotcom” effect was attributable to a desire to be “associated with the Internet at all costs” even if the companies were “at best, only loosely, if at all, connected” to it. Eventually, the boom turned to a bust, but not before many venture capitalists cashed out.</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“Web3 proponents are trying to solve real problems that need solving. I just don't think that Web3 is the solution.”</p></blockquote><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Inarguably, the hype cycle is back in full force. Kyle Samani, a managing partner at a crypto-focused investment firm, told me that although most of his limited partners don’t always fully understand the technologies behind Web3, they want exposure to “all of it.” A research report out of Citi estimated that one component of Web3, “the metaverse,” alone could have a total addressable market of <a href=\"https://ir.citi.com/gps/x5%2BFQJT3BoHXVu9MsqVRoMdiws3RhL4yhF6Fr8us8oHaOe1W9smOy1%2B8aaAgT3SPuQVtwC5B2%2Fc%3D\" target=\"_blank\">$13 trillion</a> within eight years and as many as 5 billion users. (For comparison, the entire California housing stock is currently worth <a href=\"http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2022-01-27-U-S-housing-market-has-doubled-in-value-since-the-Great-Recession-after-gaining-6-9-trillion-in-2021#:~:text=More%20than%20one%2Dfifth%20(21.3,of%20the%20bottom%2030%20states.\" target=\"_blank\">$9.2 trillion</a>; Citi is essentially claiming to believe that the metaverse will, or could, be bigger than all but three or four entire U.S. industries by the time current middle-schoolers graduate college.)</p></span></p></div><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Slava Rubin, an early-stage investor who founded Indiegogo and an alternative asset investing search engine, said the enthusiasm reminded him of the e-commerce boom of the 1990s. “Whenever there's change, there's opportunity to displace the legacy players and potentially make a lot of money on investments,” he said.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>This time, however, the world’s most well-known brands are diving in too, in order to avoid falling behind. Starbucks, ESPN, Spotify, and GameStop are developing NFT plans; Fidelity Investment, the nation’s largest 401(k) provider, is <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdb3a/fidelity-bets-the-american-retirement-system-on-the-crypto-casino\">allowing people to shove their retirement savings into Bitcoin</a>.

Facebook is Meta.</p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Over the last century, venture capitalists have backed industries that have changed the world and created millions of jobs, most famously during those early years of the internet. Less talked about is the fact that the venture class has gotten it wrong as well, said Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner, who also studies the venture industry. As an example, Lerner cited the VC-funded cleantech boom and bust at the end of the 2000s as a recent example.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“It turned out that not only was the technology a lot harder than they thought, but many of the businesses were just extremely poorly run, and some of the best firms in the business were just blinded by their enthusiasm into burning huge amounts of investor money,” Lerner said.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><div data-component=\"ImageBlock\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1654089906495-screen-shot-2022-06-01-at-92039-am.png?resize=20:*\"><source media=\"(min-width: 700px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1654089906495-screen-shot-2022-06-01-at-92039-am.png?resize=20:*\"><source media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1654089906495-screen-shot-2022-06-01-at-92039-am.png?resize=20:*\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-01 at 9.20.39 AM.png\"></picture></div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tomasz Tunguz didn’t become interested in Web3 because of its ideological underpinnings.

In August, Tomasz like many others watched in amazement as the price of the blockchain platform Solana’s token rose from $40 to $190 by mid-September, briefly reaching a market cap of almost <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/\" target=\"_blank\">$80 billion</a> by November.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“That really opened up a lot of people's eyes to the size of these companies,” Tunguz said. “The scale compels you to figure out what's going on.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The closer he looked, the greater the investment opportunity seemed. For one thing, the businesses did not have clear metrics by which they could be valued. Over the last 20 years, investors and entrepreneurs have together developed fairly reliable, standardized financial models that allow them to confidently place values on traditional software businesses after comparing them to similar older ones. “Most software businesses are really well understood. A startup walks in, and the venture capitalist just as much as the private market investors know exactly what it ought to be worth,” said Tunguz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“In Web3, that's not the case,” he added. “Nobody has any idea how to value these businesses.” He doesn’t see that as a bad thing but rather as indicative that the Web3 industry is in a period of “broad invention as opposed to optimization.”</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“Nobody has any idea how to value these businesses … It's so new that people aren't worried about unit economics,” one venture capitalist said.</p></blockquote><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>&nbsp;“I haven't walked into a single pitch with a Web3 company where the words ‘cost of customer acquisition’ or ‘payback period’ has been uttered.

(Raghavendra Rau, a Cambridge finance professor who helped discover the “dotcom” effect, agreed the Web3 industry’s underlying fundamentals were “tough to decipher,” as did others.)</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tunguz knows that lack of focus on economic fundamentals will sound “crazy” to some people, and he does believe that a “significantly higher” percentage of Web3 ventures will fail than the typical crop of startups found in a venture fund’s portfolio. But he also sees Web3’s unclear valuation metrics as a financial opportunity compared to the world of Web 2.0, which has become so well understood that it has proven harder for investors to gain an edge.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“One of the ways of making lots of money is to have information asymmetry,” Tunguz said. “If you know something I don't about a company and you trade on that information, you're gonna make a bunch of money, right? In the stock market, it's illegal. It's called MNPI—material nonpublic information. You can't do that. In the private markets, you can.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>There was one more reason Tunguz got drawn to the Web3 market: He started to see the financial potential of one of crypto’s central innovations, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crypto-token.asp\" target=\"_blank\">token</a>. The term “token” can mean many things in the crypto sphere, which makes it difficult to define in any way that is simultaneously all-encompassing and useful. Most simply, it is a tradable unit on any blockchain, but it has come to take numerous forms and functions: Tokens can be currencies, as they are with Bitcoin; they can represent voting shares, as with DAO governance tokens; they can be digital collectibles, as with an NFT of a Bored Ape; and they can be earned through online work, as they are with the “play-to-earn” game <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ag/the-metaverse-has-bosses-too-meet-the-managers-of-axie-infinity\">Axie Infinity</a>.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But professional investors have also started to view them as tradable shares of crypto projects. One such firm is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/multicoin-capital-solana-arweave-bitcoin-returns-f8e9bf82-c8d8-4917-a9d8-f0ca208bd63b.html\" target=\"_blank\">Multicoin Capital</a>, an Austin-based investment firm that “primarily” invests in tokens rather than traditional equity in startups, according to Kyle Samani, its co-founder and managing partner. Multicoin’s recent returns have been nothing short of astonishing; its <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/multicoin-capital-solana-arweave-bitcoin-returns-f8e9bf82-c8d8-4917-a9d8-f0ca208bd63b.html\" target=\"_blank\">hedge fund assets reportedly</a> shot up 20,200 percent between October 2017 and December 2021, and its venture fund secured a 28x return. Samani said he’s figured out how to approach investment in “crypto assets”—he believes the term “cryptocurrency” to be a misnomer—similarly to how a traditional investor might approach the analysis of a stock.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“You can think of the mechanisms by which these tokens capture value to be comparable to the equity of a startup,” Samani told Motherboard. “Many of these assets capture revenue directly in the same way that a startup would have revenue. And if an asset captured revenue, then you can model the valuation using a discounted cash-flow model.” Such descriptions are the reason many believe tokens should be regulated like an investment contract, or a security, since people invest in them “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp#:~:text=The%20Howey%20Test%20refers%20to,Securities%20Exchange%20Act%20of%201934.\" target=\"_blank\">with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others</a>”—the legal criteria for qualifying as a security.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“The entirety of most web3 epiphanies is ‘what if instead of selling products we sold shares instead?’” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1483756578754813952\" target=\"_blank\">Meta product manager and frequent crypto cynic Dare Obasanjo</a> has written.&nbsp;</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“You can think of the mechanisms by which these tokens capture value to be comparable to the equity of a startup,” said a partner at a crypto-focused investment firm.</p></blockquote><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tunguz has <a href=\"https://tomtunguz.com/four-fundamental-innovations-web3/\" target=\"_blank\">himself referred</a> to token-based reward systems as “paying customers in ‘equity,’” writing that as “the network becomes more valuable, so does the user’s stake in the company.” Doing so provides a reason for initial users to be invested in the company’s success, sometimes even before the company knows what product it’s going to make. This is why venture capitalists have taken to saying things like “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fintechjunkie/status/1512089054333997059\" target=\"_blank\">Web2 companies start with product. Web3 companies start with community</a>.” The tokens bring the people. Inspired by Axie Infinity, for example, Alex Kehr adopted a token-based approach with his startup, Superlocal, a version of Foursquare for the 2020s where people earn “crypto when you go places.” The token, he said, would give people “something to do in our app when nobody's there yet.” (He considers play-to-earn tokens, in particular, less likely to be deemed securities in the future.)&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Andreessen Horowitz, in its recent “<a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">State of Crypto</a>” report, argued that the token-focused structure of Web3 companies aligned the incentives of users, creators, builders, and investors in a way untokenized companies could not. “Web3 aligns network participants to work together toward a common goal—the growth of the network,” the report stated. Together, so the line of thinking goes, they all can theoretically make it.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But Tunguz (and others) saw opportunities for professional Web3 investors that those stuck in the earlier iteration of the web could not access. He realized the sector was broadly well suited for “regulatory arbitrage,” a practice in which businesses move to jurisdictions with more favorable laws or position themselves as one type of company rather than another in order avoid regulatory oversight (say, a ride-sharing company that positions itself as an app startup instead of a cab company). As Tunguz put it, the “the regulation doesn’t exist” yet in Web3, which allows the companies to access funds not available to more-traditional companies.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Traditionally, venture capitalists have had to wait years before they can receive a payout for their investments, usually during an initial public offering. Since tokens could be sold at any time, Tunguz realized Web3 investors in them had access to an asset with “immediate liquidity” instead, which can lead to a return even if the company never goes public. If they do, all the better: the equity investor can then cash out twice.</p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>One other token-related process—known as “staking”—proved particularly enticing to Tunguz. To him, it seemed as sure of a thing as they come in finance. With staking, the owner of the token hands them over for a project to use as liquidity—for crypto loans, to take one example—and in exchange earns “<a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-staking\" target=\"_blank\">a percentage-rate reward over time</a>,” as the crypto exchange Coinbase puts it. This, Tunguz realized, meant he could make money from a token regardless of whether its price went up or down. Soon enough, he was actively staking tokens in order to generate what he viewed as a remarkably high “interest rate.” (\"Tokens can generate somewhere between like 15 to, let's say, 100 percent in fixed income,” Tunguz said.)</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The discovery of such enormous fixed income in the Web3 space proved of financial interest to VCs, but Tunguz expects it will prove exceedingly exciting to institutional investors who have been focused on the bond market—“the people who buy mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, collateralized debt obligations, basically the stuff that caused the 2008 financial crisis,” he told me. “Those are the big institutional pools of capital that really want to get into DeFi because they can generate those yields.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“These big institutions are looking at these crypto tokens and saying if I can isolate myself from whether or not the price of the token goes up or down, but if I can capture the yield on a consistent basis, then I can generate maybe 10 times what I could on a bond,” he continued.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The risk inherent in such a system became clear, though, soon after we spoke. In May, the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/05/12/terra-briefly-halts-blockchain-amid-stablecoin-uproar\" target=\"_blank\">$40 billion</a> Terra-Luna ecosystem collapsed. A major factor had been that an affiliated lending protocol, Anchor, had promised a <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/forget-banks-earn-20-on-your-usd-in-defi-on-the-terra-blockchain-2b1d2844574\" target=\"_blank\">20 percent staking yield</a>. Once people started to lose confidence in the sustainability of that yield, they rushed to pull their money out, leading to Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, losing its peg to the U.S. dollar and a dramatic crash in its sister cryptocurrency, Luna.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Within days, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/147668/terra-pantera-capital-cashed-out-80-investment-before-ust-crash\" target=\"_blank\">one of Terraform Labs’ early and biggest investors</a>, the crypto-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, had quietly cashed out “roughly” four-fifths of its investment ahead of UST’s collapse, a little under $170 million on a $1.7 million investment. The news infuriated many retail investors, who saw it as proof of what many in crypto suspected: professional investors gaining an early edge, loudly pumping up the project, quietly cashing out—the dump—and then moving on to the next token.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>A video clip of the investors and podcasters Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya seemingly joking about dumping their Solana tokens <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qma4ry/solana_vc_investors_appear_to_be_laughing_about/\" target=\"_blank\">drew similar ire</a> last year, as the blockchain was heavily supported by professional investors early on. “One way an impatient VC could manipulate a project is by insisting that a startup offer tokens as part of their project, and require that a certain amount of tokens be set aside for the VC,” the <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/theres-something-off-about-apecoin?s=r\" target=\"_blank\">technology journalist Casey Newton</a> recently wrote. “That way, once the tokens become available for trading on public crypto exchanges, VCs can cash out part of their investment years ahead of schedule. Or, if the project fails before it can sell or go public, the VC can earn a profit on an investment that would have otherwise been a loss.”</p></span></p><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Newton made the comments following the release of ApeCoin token, all but officially associated with Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, or BAYC. ApeCoin’s organizing body, ApeCoin DAO, had dedicated nearly a fourth of all tokens to BAYC’s co-founders and \"the companies and people that helped make this project a reality,\" which <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/theres-something-off-about-apecoin?s=r\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> included venture capitalists.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>This sort of insidery dealmaking is why many in the crypto sphere have become suspicious of the professional investor class. Web3 projects have started requiring VCs to lock up their holding to avoid a professional pump-and-dump, and VCs have been reduced to writing about why people <em>should</em> take their money. (“There are many alternatives to venture capital these days, particularly in web3, but there are few, if any, alternatives that stick with you, when times are tough,” <a href=\"https://avc.com/2021/12/why-web3/\" target=\"_blank\">the investor Fred Wilson wrote</a> in December.)&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>And yet, the VCs’ influence over the startup system remains unquestionable. A “<a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/theres-something-off-about-apecoin?s=r\" target=\"_blank\">VC friend</a>” &nbsp;recently told Newton “they are hearing about startups being pressured to offer tokens.” <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Gerard, the Norby CEO, similarly started to hear of companies getting pressure to mint tokens.&nbsp;</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“They've failed to find incentives in their Web2 companies. So building something in Web3, it's almost like a cop-out for some people. They're like, ‘Oh, we're just gonna ping a token on top of it.’”</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>But the more he learned about them, the more skeptical he became. He started to believe that tokens, rather than the ideological “future of a fully decentralized internet,” were behind a lot of the investor interest in Web3, he told me. As he sees it, an investment firm could invest in a startup in exchange for equity and inside information and then negotiate a hoard of early tokens. “What I have now is asymmetric access to information,” Gerard said. “I have a direct line to a founder that every single person in the Discord doesn't have. I have access to financial information. I know if user adoption is tanking. I know if usage is skyrocketing. I know if the founder is depressed or hooked on Adderall or is spiraling out of control.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Then, at the first internal sign of trouble, the investor can dump the token on the “quote-unquote community,” Gerard said.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“That is a radical change in the way this industry works,” he said. “Some of them are quite transparent about it, but they're still able to couch all of this in language that revolves around ownership and the community.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Last summer, as Gerard weighed his own pivot, he kept hearing about founders who were making the switch simply because doing so made it easier to raise money.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>A venture capitalist who asked that I not use his name so he could speak freely about his firm’s investments, admitted with concern that one of his own portfolio companies did the same, and other founders and CEOs similarly said they’d noticed startups cynically bolting on Web3 elements after running out of other options and needing more funding to survive.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“They've failed to find incentives in their Web2 companies,” said Mills, the CEO who himself pivoted to start a Web3 gaming platform, said of such companies. “So building something in Web3, it's almost like a cop-out for some people. They're like, ‘Oh, we're just gonna ping a token on top of it.’”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“We see so many of these,” agreed Jeff Clavier, the founder of the venture firm Uncork Capital. “Web3 is the new trend, and a lot of entrepreneurs add that as an afterthought.” Tiny Rebel Games CEO Susan Cummings said attempting to superficially “jerry-rig” an element to raise money can be a dangerous bet for a startup. Who is doing that in Web3 is difficult to decipher. An investor accused Cummings herself of bolting on an unnecessary Web3 element when she pitched him on the Petaverse Network, a Web3 project in which people build digital pets that can then live with them in various metaverses. “He turned us down, saying I don't see why you need blockchain,” she said. “That's true. You could store it in a database.” She contended that the potential interoperability and ownership of the Web3-based idea “made it better” and went on to raise $7 million, double what she set out to raise.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>What everyone can seem to agree on is that the boom has created a lot of vaporware and useless entrepreneurial attempts to get rich quick, even if no one wants to name names on the record.&nbsp;</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“Tack on Web3, and investors will throw money blindly and inflate valuations 2-3x.”</p></blockquote><p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists alike described companies that bolt on a Web3 element in order to raise a few more bucks as “grifters.” Venture capitalists say such companies are easy to spot. Even if that’s true for the most part, a founder told me he’s noticed bolting on a Web3 element adds investor interest, whatever its relevance.&nbsp; “Tack on Web3,” the founder said, “and investors will throw money blindly and inflate valuations 2-3x.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Gerard, the Norby CEO, dealt with real periods of “self-doubt” as he decided whether to pivot into Web3. Sometimes, he worried he was being stupid. But ultimately, he decided, if his customers weren’t clamoring for it, he didn’t see a reason to pivot.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“If that's something that we start to hear from our customers, then it's absolutely something that we are going to take a look at and figure out what version of it makes sense for us,” he told me. But for now, he added, “We can't force people to want something that they don't want.”</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The question for now&nbsp; is how long the regulatory-arbitrage party will last. The regulators are encircling what <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-03/citi-did-a-flash-crash\" target=\"_blank\">many see</a> as illegal financial activity. Repeatedly in recent months, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has reiterated that he believes many crypto tokens should be <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-nasaa-spring-meeting-051722?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1\" target=\"_blank\">regulated as securities</a>.&nbsp; “Let’s not risk undermining 90 years of securities laws and create some regulatory arbitrage or loopholes,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1529099913602052096\" target=\"_blank\">he said at the University of Pennsylvania’s April law conference</a>.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>The rise of tokenization in particular has frustrated Web3 critics. Meta’s Obasanjo has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1464981399987961859\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> it’s a “mind-blowing” and “tremendous hack” that “it’s legal to effectively sell stock without regulation if you say it grants voting rights but not ownership.” Martha Bennett, a vice president at Forrester Research who studies blockchain technology and digital assets, described them as an “abuse of the system.” The English crypto critic Stephen Diehl <a href=\"https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/disconnect.html\" target=\"_blank\">has contended</a> that the “crypto-token-as-equity-proxy scheme” put the financial rules of the 1920s back in play by allowing people to “insider trade, wash trade, and pump and dump” with impunity.&nbsp;</p></span></p><blockquote data-component=\"QuoteBlock\"><p>“What we have with tokens is another way of creating leverage.

Allen, the law professor who studies financial regulation, has spent much of her time recently studying the similarities between financial products that make up Web3 and the collection of instruments that led to the Great Recession. In tokens, Allen sees an innovation that is at its core comparable to the credit default swap. The two are different—credit default swaps allow numerous people to make a bet on a bond’s future performance—but at the end of the day, both help greatly increase potential leverage in the financial system, she said.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“Leverage is great in good times, because it allows you to multiply your profits.

And now, Allen and others hope the Web3 system will be placed under regulatory control before history repeats itself.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>Tunguz, the pro-Web3 venture capitalist, is ready for such a day, but reaping the rewards until then.</p></span><span data-component=\"TextBlock\"><p>“There will be a Securities Act of 2033, whatever the year is,” said Tunguz. “Whenever the regulation comes out, we will respond to it.

There are, suddenly, Web3 media companies, Web3 advertising firms, Web3 studios, Web3 marketing tactics, and Web3 publishing networks. LimeWire and MoviePass have risen from the dead, newly “powered”—as one of their CEOs put it—“by Web3 technology.” Web3 apparently is not only “transforming gaming” and “re-engineering real estate,” but also the future of the internet, and maybe the entire global economy as well. Never mind that very few people can agree on exactly what Web3 is (and isn’t). What matters to investors is that Web3 is the hot new thing and the entrepreneurs are piling in. One venture capitalist, Hadley Harris, told me that roughly half the Web3 pitches he’d recently looked over came from founders who weren’t even in the space half a year ago. That’s a claim backed up by Alchemy, a company that considers itself the Web3 infrastructural equivalent of Amazon Web Services; it said in February that “hundreds of established Web2 companies” are pivoting into Web3 using its platform. Even new pharmaceutical companies are now taking a Web3 “crypto-first approach,” with one raising the possibility of issuing a “cryptocurrency token to participants in its clinical trials.” “A lot of people are trying to get in on it, and a lot of people are more afraid of not getting in.”The pace of the pivots can feel almost frenetic. One Ottawa-based entrepreneur, worried the world was passing him by, surprised his employees on a company Zoom call by saying he was pivoting the entire company into Web3. “I said, ‘Guys, this is the future and this is where everything is going,’” he said. “‘If we miss this boat, I don't think we can ever get back on.’” (The company, which had been a print-on-demand platform, now helps creators build 3D NFTs to sell to fans in the metaverse.)Like a lot of his fellow entrepreneurs, Nick Gerard, the CEO and co- founder of Norby, a startup focused on the creator economy,  started to notice last year that one by one, his competitors were also diving headfirst into the world of crypto and Web3. Gerard said potential investors in Norby were pushing him to take the Web3 leap as well. But Gerard couldn’t help but feel confused by the whole thing. His customers, the people he thought mattered most, rarely showed much interest in Web3 technologies at all. “I can count on one hand the number of times I have actually heard ‘NFTs’ come out of one of these people's mouths,” he told me. Even still, he and the rest of his team mulled over whether to make the switch, fearful that they were missing something everyone else could see. “Nobody wants to be Paul Krugman,” Gerard said, referring to an infamous 1998 quote in which the Nobel Prize–winning economist predicted that the internet would ultimately become no more consequential than the fax machine. (He's also famously anti-Bitcoin and crypto.)Have you worked or invested in Web3? We want to hear from you. From a non-work device, contact our reporter at maxwell.strachan@vice.com or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.The Web3 hysteria has continued this year even as the tech industry more broadly has struggled with rising interest rates and plummeting share prices. “In the last six months, it's gotten fairly ridiculous,” said one partner at a crypto-focused investment firm. In the first three months of the year, the top 15 venture firms poured more money into Web3 and DeFi early- and seed-stage deals than any other area, the third straight quarter they have done so, according to the research firm Pitchbook. In total, the early- and seed-stage Web3 world nabbed $2 billion from top firms last quarter, more than double what the next-highest sector, biotechnology, received, and triple what traditional fintech got. Those figures understate the total level of interest—and money—in the space. Blockchain companies have raised at least $9.5 billion after receiving $18 billion in funding in 2021, according to numbers the research firm CrunchBase provided to Motherboard. And more firepower is on the way. In late May, amid plunging crypto prices, one of Web3’s biggest institutional backers, the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, announced it had raised a monstrous $4.5 billion crypto fund following a series of high-profile investments into Web3 projects like play-to-earn game Axie Infinity and the parent company of the Bored Ape Yacht Club.“It’s a gold rush for sure,” said Dayton Mills, the co-founder and CEO of Branch. Mills’ company had been a struggling remote-work startup before he transformed it into a Web3 gaming platform. The moment he started talking about his Web3 vision, investor interest skyrocketed. “It was a tremendous difference,” he said.  “There were people who I didn't even meet with who were just committing over email without ever even talking to me.” He had planned to raise $2 million, only to receive $20 million in commitments in two weeks. “We stopped because it just was incredibly overwhelming.”“Something big is happening,” Mills added. “A lot of people are trying to get in on it, and a lot of people are more afraid of not getting in.” What exactly they are getting in on is harder to pin down. The term “Web3” is sometimes attributed to Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, who, in 2014, described an idealized version of the web in which the system placed no trust in organizations but near-complete trust in blockchain technology. But it didn’t enter the mainstream cultural vernacular until last year, when it started to serve as a catchall (and, coincidentally, a venture-led rebranding) for the collection of controversial  financial-technology products that include cryptocurrencies, blockchains, non-fungible tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations (or “DAOs”), the metaverse, and decentralized financial (or DeFi) products. “It’s like a collective Theranos. A wildly unproven product with nobody at the helm,” one venture capitalist said.To some, like Andreessen Horowitz, what ties these innovations together is that they collectively offer a theoretical vision where people have “the ability to own a piece of the internet”—for example, through the use of NFTs, which are essentially tradable proof-of-ownership receipts. In such a world, people could use and even monetize their NFTs on multiple platforms, rather than just on, say, Instagram. Such a system, boosters believe—or, at least, claim to believe—will lead to a fairer, more communal version of the web, one that will wrest control back from technological giants that have profited off people’s data and creativity, creating a world where community comes before all else. Much of the ideological rhetoric hence involves talk of using Web3 “to truly empower financial inclusion” (again, Andreessen Horowitz’s words) by bringing people into the fold who have been marginalized by the traditional financial structure. Such arguments are inarguably alluring. Very few people feel the financial and internet structures that underpin society could not be vastly improved. But they also belie the fact that professional investors do not push their money into the middle of the craps table solely in order to better the world. As Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University, succinctly put it: “The reason why venture capitalists are pushing all of this is to make money.”  And in Web3, the venture class and other professional investors have found a uniquely appealing set of circumstances they believe will allow them to make a giant pile of money that does not rely on vast leaps in virtual reality or haptics technology—sometimes by pulling off an impressive degree of regulatory arbitrage, other times by taking advantage of a wholly new kind of internet marketplace. “If there is any innovation in crypto assets, it’s not in software engineering but in financial engineering,” the London-based software engineer and crypto critic Stephen Diehl has written. Allen, who studies financial regulation, sees the rhetoric around empowerment and inclusion as little more than a  “cynical” ploy. She and others believe it masks the aspects of the Web3 apparatus that have made it appetizing to venture capitalists, billionaires, and other institutional players—so much so that they have moved aggressively to plant a foothold in spite of the industry’s unmistakable propensity for scams, fraud, and regulatory scrutiny. Here we have a largely unregulated marketplace ripe for exploitation and stuffed full of unclear valuation metrics, arguable unregistered securities, peculiar financial products, ways to cash out, and a public-facing ideological mission statement.Of particular fascination has been the critical role in the Web3 ecosystem of the token, a new type of financial product that regulators are still struggling to get a handle on but that venture capitalists have realized allows them to cash out quickly and handsomely even if the company never goes public (and twice over if they do).  It is, at least for now, close to a perfect playing field for the professional money-making class, one that is leading to pressures to pivot or die, whatever the utility.  One entrepreneur described with great frustration that he had recently spoken to a founder at a VC mixer who was building a “decentralized” dinner reservation system. When he asked why a reservation system needed to be on the blockchain, the founder simply said: “It’s the future.” It’s at least possible that Web3 could bring about a better, more fulfilling version of the internet. It’s just as likely, though, to prove to be what its harshest critics fear: a “hyper-capitalistic” reframing of the web that “contains the seeds of a dystopian nightmare.” “It’s like a collective Theranos,” one venture capitalist said. “A wildly unproven product with nobody at the helm.”A great many Web3 entrepreneurs and investors appear sincerely passionate about their mission of creating a better version of the internet. To many of these people, Web3 is not an idyllic possibility but an all-out inevitability, spoken about with an almost religious fervor. “It really feels ideological to me, and it's weird, because VCs tend not to invest in ideologies,” said Phil Libin, the former co-founder and CEO of Evernote. Indeed, soon after a recent string of crypto controversies, including the precipitous May crash of the Luna cryptocurrency and its sister “stablecoin” UST, Andreessen Horowitz said Web3 was just now entering its “golden era.” The same week, it announced an investment in former WeWork CEO’s Adam Neumann’s Web3 climate venture selling “Goddess Nature Tokens.”Another such believer, Benjamin Cohen, who recently started a Web3-focused investment fund, told a crypto site in March that it was “inevitable that blockchain technology and smart contract technology will become implemented in every single facet of our life.” That is not an isolated opinion. “Every single company that exists is going to exist in some form of Web3,” Alexander Taub, the Miami-based co-founder of the DAO-creation tool Upstream, told Motherboard in a Zoom interview. (Taub, who wore a “Just DAO It” hat, added that “the potential market size for DAOs is, like, trillions.”)A lot of the believer class come across as “zealots” who are dismissive of those who question them, according to Jason Henrichs, the CEO of Alloy Labs Alliance, who has spoken to Web3 projects about potential investment (and moved forward with some). The technology writer and researcher Evgeny Morozov has gone so far as to compare them to “annoying vulgar Marxists who, for all the evidence to the contrary, kept [and keep] insisting that the objective developments within capitalism favor the inevitable transition to socialism.” On its face, their level of confidence does indeed appear odd, or at least premature.  One January survey by the strategy firm National Research Group found that only 13 percent of surveyed American adults knew what Web3 meant, and that more than half have never heard the term. A separate poll from around the same time said less than two in five members of Generation Z believed “the metaverse is the next big thing and will become part of our lives in the next decade.” Andreessen Horowitz claims there are 22,400 Web3 creators, and only 18,000 developers were working in crypto or Web3 by the end of 2021, according to one recent survey by Electric Capita, nothing compared to the more than 27 million developers in the world. Some wonder if the Web3 hype is justified at all. Libin had been initially drawn to the “beautiful” and “elegant” concepts of Web3, he said. The CEO of the startup studio All Turtles and the virtual camera application mmhmm, as well as a former VC at General Catalyst, Libin has made a career out of searching out companies that solve real problems with clear business models. But as he started hearing from more and more Web3 companies, he found himself unable to understand what benefit came from developing certain projects on the blockchain as opposed to, for example, using an internal database. When he started to challenge some of the pitches he received, he didn’t like the answers he got. Using such technologies often seemed needlessly expensive and prone to exploitation by hackers and scammers.“Web3 proponents are trying to solve real problems that need solving. I just don't think that Web3 is the solution,” he said. “It doesn't make sense to me as a programmer.” The common pro-Web3 counterargument—often repeated by VCs—is that proponents are simply early, like with the internet of the 1990s. Such unbridled optimism is not novel to Web3, but instead core to the venture and technology industries’ model, according to Martin Kenney, a professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the industry. The investors’ goal is always to sell the company, and they have an incentive to target hot sectors and then aid in raising interest in them. “Whatever the new thing is, it’s absolutely in the VC’s interest to hype it. You’d be a fool not to,” said Kenney. “So you feed it to the press. You tell everyone it's going to change the world, that it is the best thing since sliced bread, whatever it is that will convince the investors that they need to have it.”It can be convincing, and was famously so in the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, during which time companies that added a “.com” to their name experienced a “dramatic” and “permanent” rise in valuation immediately after the rebrand, “regardless of the firm's level of involvement with the Internet,” according to a study on the so-called “dotcom” effect. The researchers determined this so-called “dotcom” effect was attributable to a desire to be “associated with the Internet at all costs” even if the companies were “at best, only loosely, if at all, connected” to it. Eventually, the boom turned to a bust, but not before many venture capitalists cashed out.“Web3 proponents are trying to solve real problems that need solving. I just don't think that Web3 is the solution.”Inarguably, the hype cycle is back in full force. Kyle Samani, a managing partner at a crypto-focused investment firm, told me that although most of his limited partners don’t always fully understand the technologies behind Web3, they want exposure to “all of it.” A research report out of Citi estimated that one component of Web3, “the metaverse,” alone could have a total addressable market of $13 trillion within eight years and as many as 5 billion users. (For comparison, the entire California housing stock is currently worth $9.2 trillion; Citi is essentially claiming to believe that the metaverse will, or could, be bigger than all but three or four entire U.S. industries by the time current middle-schoolers graduate college.)Slava Rubin, an early-stage investor who founded Indiegogo and an alternative asset investing search engine, said the enthusiasm reminded him of the e-commerce boom of the 1990s. “Whenever there's change, there's opportunity to displace the legacy players and potentially make a lot of money on investments,” he said. This time, however, the world’s most well-known brands are diving in too, in order to avoid falling behind. Starbucks, ESPN, Spotify, and GameStop are developing NFT plans; Fidelity Investment, the nation’s largest 401(k) provider, is allowing people to shove their retirement savings into Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs is offering crypto-backed loans. JPMorgan Chase, Gucci, and Miller Lite are hunkering down in the metaverse. Google has a dedicated Web3 team. Facebook is Meta.Over the last century, venture capitalists have backed industries that have changed the world and created millions of jobs, most famously during those early years of the internet. Less talked about is the fact that the venture class has gotten it wrong as well, said Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner, who also studies the venture industry. As an example, Lerner cited the VC-funded cleantech boom and bust at the end of the 2000s as a recent example. “It turned out that not only was the technology a lot harder than they thought, but many of the businesses were just extremely poorly run, and some of the best firms in the business were just blinded by their enthusiasm into burning huge amounts of investor money,” Lerner said. Tomasz Tunguz didn’t become interested in Web3 because of its ideological underpinnings. Like a lot of investors, he saw a chance to make a lot of money because of the economic particularities of the Web3 ecosystem.  Tunguz, a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures who writes a popular blog about the industry, became active in the Web3 market in the first half of last year after he noticed the businesses were both capital efficient and could scale to enormous size. In August, Tomasz like many others watched in amazement as the price of the blockchain platform Solana’s token rose from $40 to $190 by mid-September, briefly reaching a market cap of almost $80 billion by November.“That really opened up a lot of people's eyes to the size of these companies,” Tunguz said. “The scale compels you to figure out what's going on.”The closer he looked, the greater the investment opportunity seemed. For one thing, the businesses did not have clear metrics by which they could be valued. Over the last 20 years, investors and entrepreneurs have together developed fairly reliable, standardized financial models that allow them to confidently place values on traditional software businesses after comparing them to similar older ones. “Most software businesses are really well understood. A startup walks in, and the venture capitalist just as much as the private market investors know exactly what it ought to be worth,” said Tunguz.  “In Web3, that's not the case,” he added. “Nobody has any idea how to value these businesses.” He doesn’t see that as a bad thing but rather as indicative that the Web3 industry is in a period of “broad invention as opposed to optimization.”“Nobody has any idea how to value these businesses … It's so new that people aren't worried about unit economics,” one venture capitalist said. “I haven't walked into a single pitch with a Web3 company where the words ‘cost of customer acquisition’ or ‘payback period’ has been uttered. It's so new that people aren't worried about unit economics,” Tunguz said. (Raghavendra Rau, a Cambridge finance professor who helped discover the “dotcom” effect, agreed the Web3 industry’s underlying fundamentals were “tough to decipher,” as did others.)Tunguz knows that lack of focus on economic fundamentals will sound “crazy” to some people, and he does believe that a “significantly higher” percentage of Web3 ventures will fail than the typical crop of startups found in a venture fund’s portfolio. But he also sees Web3’s unclear valuation metrics as a financial opportunity compared to the world of Web 2.0, which has become so well understood that it has proven harder for investors to gain an edge. “One of the ways of making lots of money is to have information asymmetry,” Tunguz said. “If you know something I don't about a company and you trade on that information, you're gonna make a bunch of money, right? In the stock market, it's illegal. It's called MNPI—material nonpublic information. You can't do that. In the private markets, you can.”There was one more reason Tunguz got drawn to the Web3 market: He started to see the financial potential of one of crypto’s central innovations, the token. The term “token” can mean many things in the crypto sphere, which makes it difficult to define in any way that is simultaneously all-encompassing and useful. Most simply, it is a tradable unit on any blockchain, but it has come to take numerous forms and functions: Tokens can be currencies, as they are with Bitcoin; they can represent voting shares, as with DAO governance tokens; they can be digital collectibles, as with an NFT of a Bored Ape; and they can be earned through online work, as they are with the “play-to-earn” game Axie Infinity.But professional investors have also started to view them as tradable shares of crypto projects. One such firm is Multicoin Capital, an Austin-based investment firm that “primarily” invests in tokens rather than traditional equity in startups, according to Kyle Samani, its co-founder and managing partner. Multicoin’s recent returns have been nothing short of astonishing; its hedge fund assets reportedly shot up 20,200 percent between October 2017 and December 2021, and its venture fund secured a 28x return. Samani said he’s figured out how to approach investment in “crypto assets”—he believes the term “cryptocurrency” to be a misnomer—similarly to how a traditional investor might approach the analysis of a stock. “You can think of the mechanisms by which these tokens capture value to be comparable to the equity of a startup,” Samani told Motherboard. “Many of these assets capture revenue directly in the same way that a startup would have revenue. And if an asset captured revenue, then you can model the valuation using a discounted cash-flow model.” Such descriptions are the reason many believe tokens should be regulated like an investment contract, or a security, since people invest in them “with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others”—the legal criteria for qualifying as a security. “The entirety of most web3 epiphanies is ‘what if instead of selling products we sold shares instead?’” Meta product manager and frequent crypto cynic Dare Obasanjo has written. “You can think of the mechanisms by which these tokens capture value to be comparable to the equity of a startup,” said a partner at a crypto-focused investment firm.Tunguz has himself referred to token-based reward systems as “paying customers in ‘equity,’” writing that as “the network becomes more valuable, so does the user’s stake in the company.” Doing so provides a reason for initial users to be invested in the company’s success, sometimes even before the company knows what product it’s going to make. This is why venture capitalists have taken to saying things like “Web2 companies start with product. Web3 companies start with community.” The tokens bring the people. Inspired by Axie Infinity, for example, Alex Kehr adopted a token-based approach with his startup, Superlocal, a version of Foursquare for the 2020s where people earn “crypto when you go places.” The token, he said, would give people “something to do in our app when nobody's there yet.” (He considers play-to-earn tokens, in particular, less likely to be deemed securities in the future.) Andreessen Horowitz, in its recent “State of Crypto” report, argued that the token-focused structure of Web3 companies aligned the incentives of users, creators, builders, and investors in a way untokenized companies could not. “Web3 aligns network participants to work together toward a common goal—the growth of the network,” the report stated. Together, so the line of thinking goes, they all can theoretically make it.But Tunguz (and others) saw opportunities for professional Web3 investors that those stuck in the earlier iteration of the web could not access. He realized the sector was broadly well suited for “regulatory arbitrage,” a practice in which businesses move to jurisdictions with more favorable laws or position themselves as one type of company rather than another in order avoid regulatory oversight (say, a ride-sharing company that positions itself as an app startup instead of a cab company). As Tunguz put it, the “the regulation doesn’t exist” yet in Web3, which allows the companies to access funds not available to more-traditional companies. Traditionally, venture capitalists have had to wait years before they can receive a payout for their investments, usually during an initial public offering. Since tokens could be sold at any time, Tunguz realized Web3 investors in them had access to an asset with “immediate liquidity” instead, which can lead to a return even if the company never goes public. If they do, all the better: the equity investor can then cash out twice.One other token-related process—known as “staking”—proved particularly enticing to Tunguz. To him, it seemed as sure of a thing as they come in finance. With staking, the owner of the token hands them over for a project to use as liquidity—for crypto loans, to take one example—and in exchange earns “a percentage-rate reward over time,” as the crypto exchange Coinbase puts it. This, Tunguz realized, meant he could make money from a token regardless of whether its price went up or down. Soon enough, he was actively staking tokens in order to generate what he viewed as a remarkably high “interest rate.” (\"Tokens can generate somewhere between like 15 to, let's say, 100 percent in fixed income,” Tunguz said.)The discovery of such enormous fixed income in the Web3 space proved of financial interest to VCs, but Tunguz expects it will prove exceedingly exciting to institutional investors who have been focused on the bond market—“the people who buy mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, collateralized debt obligations, basically the stuff that caused the 2008 financial crisis,” he told me. “Those are the big institutional pools of capital that really want to get into DeFi because they can generate those yields.”“These big institutions are looking at these crypto tokens and saying if I can isolate myself from whether or not the price of the token goes up or down, but if I can capture the yield on a consistent basis, then I can generate maybe 10 times what I could on a bond,” he continued. The risk inherent in such a system became clear, though, soon after we spoke. In May, the $40 billion Terra-Luna ecosystem collapsed. A major factor had been that an affiliated lending protocol, Anchor, had promised a 20 percent staking yield. Once people started to lose confidence in the sustainability of that yield, they rushed to pull their money out, leading to Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, losing its peg to the U.S. dollar and a dramatic crash in its sister cryptocurrency, Luna. Within days, it was reported that one of Terraform Labs’ early and biggest investors, the crypto-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, had quietly cashed out “roughly” four-fifths of its investment ahead of UST’s collapse, a little under $170 million on a $1.7 million investment. The news infuriated many retail investors, who saw it as proof of what many in crypto suspected: professional investors gaining an early edge, loudly pumping up the project, quietly cashing out—the dump—and then moving on to the next token. A video clip of the investors and podcasters Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya seemingly joking about dumping their Solana tokens drew similar ire last year, as the blockchain was heavily supported by professional investors early on. “One way an impatient VC could manipulate a project is by insisting that a startup offer tokens as part of their project, and require that a certain amount of tokens be set aside for the VC,” the technology journalist Casey Newton recently wrote. “That way, once the tokens become available for trading on public crypto exchanges, VCs can cash out part of their investment years ahead of schedule. Or, if the project fails before it can sell or go public, the VC can earn a profit on an investment that would have otherwise been a loss.”Newton made the comments following the release of ApeCoin token, all but officially associated with Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, or BAYC. ApeCoin’s organizing body, ApeCoin DAO, had dedicated nearly a fourth of all tokens to BAYC’s co-founders and \"the companies and people that helped make this project a reality,\" which reportedly included venture capitalists. This sort of insidery dealmaking is why many in the crypto sphere have become suspicious of the professional investor class. Web3 projects have started requiring VCs to lock up their holding to avoid a professional pump-and-dump, and VCs have been reduced to writing about why people should take their money. (“There are many alternatives to venture capital these days, particularly in web3, but there are few, if any, alternatives that stick with you, when times are tough,” the investor Fred Wilson wrote in December.) And yet, the VCs’ influence over the startup system remains unquestionable. A “VC friend”  recently told Newton “they are hearing about startups being pressured to offer tokens.”  Gerard, the Norby CEO, similarly started to hear of companies getting pressure to mint tokens. “They've failed to find incentives in their Web2 companies. So building something in Web3, it's almost like a cop-out for some people. They're like, ‘Oh, we're just gonna ping a token on top of it.’”But the more he learned about them, the more skeptical he became. He started to believe that tokens, rather than the ideological “future of a fully decentralized internet,” were behind a lot of the investor interest in Web3, he told me. As he sees it, an investment firm could invest in a startup in exchange for equity and inside information and then negotiate a hoard of early tokens. “What I have now is asymmetric access to information,” Gerard said. “I have a direct line to a founder that every single person in the Discord doesn't have. I have access to financial information. I know if user adoption is tanking. I know if usage is skyrocketing. I know if the founder is depressed or hooked on Adderall or is spiraling out of control.” Then, at the first internal sign of trouble, the investor can dump the token on the “quote-unquote community,” Gerard said.“That is a radical change in the way this industry works,” he said. “Some of them are quite transparent about it, but they're still able to couch all of this in language that revolves around ownership and the community.”Last summer, as Gerard weighed his own pivot, he kept hearing about founders who were making the switch simply because doing so made it easier to raise money. A venture capitalist who asked that I not use his name so he could speak freely about his firm’s investments, admitted with concern that one of his own portfolio companies did the same, and other founders and CEOs similarly said they’d noticed startups cynically bolting on Web3 elements after running out of other options and needing more funding to survive. “They've failed to find incentives in their Web2 companies,” said Mills, the CEO who himself pivoted to start a Web3 gaming platform, said of such companies. “So building something in Web3, it's almost like a cop-out for some people. They're like, ‘Oh, we're just gonna ping a token on top of it.’” “We see so many of these,” agreed Jeff Clavier, the founder of the venture firm Uncork Capital. “Web3 is the new trend, and a lot of entrepreneurs add that as an afterthought.” Tiny Rebel Games CEO Susan Cummings said attempting to superficially “jerry-rig” an element to raise money can be a dangerous bet for a startup. Who is doing that in Web3 is difficult to decipher. An investor accused Cummings herself of bolting on an unnecessary Web3 element when she pitched him on the Petaverse Network, a Web3 project in which people build digital pets that can then live with them in various metaverses. “He turned us down, saying I don't see why you need blockchain,” she said. “That's true. You could store it in a database.” She contended that the potential interoperability and ownership of the Web3-based idea “made it better” and went on to raise $7 million, double what she set out to raise.What everyone can seem to agree on is that the boom has created a lot of vaporware and useless entrepreneurial attempts to get rich quick, even if no one wants to name names on the record. “Tack on Web3, and investors will throw money blindly and inflate valuations 2-3x.”Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists alike described companies that bolt on a Web3 element in order to raise a few more bucks as “grifters.” Venture capitalists say such companies are easy to spot. Even if that’s true for the most part, a founder told me he’s noticed bolting on a Web3 element adds investor interest, whatever its relevance.  “Tack on Web3,” the founder said, “and investors will throw money blindly and inflate valuations 2-3x.”Gerard, the Norby CEO, dealt with real periods of “self-doubt” as he decided whether to pivot into Web3. Sometimes, he worried he was being stupid. But ultimately, he decided, if his customers weren’t clamoring for it, he didn’t see a reason to pivot.“If that's something that we start to hear from our customers, then it's absolutely something that we are going to take a look at and figure out what version of it makes sense for us,” he told me. But for now, he added, “We can't force people to want something that they don't want.”The question for now  is how long the regulatory-arbitrage party will last. The regulators are encircling what many see as illegal financial activity. Repeatedly in recent months, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has reiterated that he believes many crypto tokens should be regulated as securities.  “Let’s not risk undermining 90 years of securities laws and create some regulatory arbitrage or loopholes,” he said at the University of Pennsylvania’s April law conference.The rise of tokenization in particular has frustrated Web3 critics. Meta’s Obasanjo has said it’s a “mind-blowing” and “tremendous hack” that “it’s legal to effectively sell stock without regulation if you say it grants voting rights but not ownership.” Martha Bennett, a vice president at Forrester Research who studies blockchain technology and digital assets, described them as an “abuse of the system.” The English crypto critic Stephen Diehl has contended that the “crypto-token-as-equity-proxy scheme” put the financial rules of the 1920s back in play by allowing people to “insider trade, wash trade, and pump and dump” with impunity. “What we have with tokens is another way of creating leverage. Now, it's the asset itself that is synthetic,” said a law professor comparing crypto tokens to credit default swaps.Hilary J. Allen, the law professor who studies financial regulation, has spent much of her time recently studying the similarities between financial products that make up Web3 and the collection of instruments that led to the Great Recession. In tokens, Allen sees an innovation that is at its core comparable to the credit default swap. The two are different—credit default swaps allow numerous people to make a bet on a bond’s future performance—but at the end of the day, both help greatly increase potential leverage in the financial system, she said.“Leverage is great in good times, because it allows you to multiply your profits. But it means that the system is very much more fragile, because even small amounts of losses on your investments will wipe you out,” she said. “What we have with tokens is another way of creating leverage. But now, it's not about lots of contracts referencing the bonds; now, it's the asset itself that is synthetic—there's no limit on the number of tokens that we can create.”Allen doesn’t mince words when she discusses her worst-case future scenario: “major systemic implosion.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the crypto industry is not yet at the scale to pose “financial stability concerns,\" and President Joe Biden has expressed support for “responsible” crypto innovation, but the rhetoric of financial democratization nevertheless reminds Allen of before the subprime housing bubble burst, when a collection of complex financial innovations like mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations were seen as avenues through which new swaths of people could have access to wealth. And now, Allen and others hope the Web3 system will be placed under regulatory control before history repeats itself. Tunguz, the pro-Web3 venture capitalist, is ready for such a day, but reaping the rewards until then.“There will be a Securities Act of 2033, whatever the year is,” said Tunguz. “Whenever the regulation comes out, we will respond to it. But I think there's definitely an opportunity here to make money in a way that benefits everybody within the ecosystem.”","length":37361,"excerpt":"It can feel as if the entire world is bolting on crypto tokens and NFTs.
