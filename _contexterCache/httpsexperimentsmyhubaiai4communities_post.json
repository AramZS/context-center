Links to the latest and previous versions, if any, are in the footer.</em></p>\n<p>In my last post I highlighted how the authors of the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y\">model collapse paper</a> in <em>Nature</em> pointed out that in the future any data stemming from “<em>genuine human interactions … will be increasingly valuable</em>” for training the next generation of LLMs. Online, there’s nothing more genuinely human than the interactions in a well-managed digital community, so “<em>after greed and short-sightedness floods the commons with low-grade AI content…</em> <strong><em>well-managed online communities of actual human beings [may be] the only place able to provide the sort of data tomorrow’s LLMs will need” (</em></strong><a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-model-collapse-could-revive-authentic-human-communities-e723d8048ef3\">How Model Collapse could revive authentic human communities</a>).</p>\n<p>This supports the <strong>AI4Communities</strong> idea, first outlined in <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4\">A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence</a> in January 2023, which envisions tomorrow’s online denizens thriving in a wide range of <em>“</em><a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4\"><strong><em>small is beautiful communities</em></strong><em>, supported by AIs which the communities themselves own, train and monetise</em></a><em>”</em>, rather than putting up with whatever Meta’s or X’s global, “one size fits all” algorithms inflict on them to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>If model collapse has made AI4Communities more feasible, what is it exactly, how do we get there, and who’s building it? But first, why care?</p>\n<h3>What is the Cozyweb, and why is Small Beautiful?</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://publicinfrastructure.org/2023/03/29/the-three-legged-stool/\">Three Legged Stool manifesto</a>, <strong>“Very Small Online Platforms (VSOPs)”</strong> are <em>“social networks created for a very specific purpose, with rules, norms and affordances appropriate to that community”</em> (<a href=\"https://newpublic.substack.com/p/a-social-network-taxonomy\">A social network taxonomy</a>). While they’re obviously playing with the EU’s term for “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2413\">Very Large Online Platforms</a>”, they see VSOPs as separate from <strong>federated servers</strong>, which combine small size and large reach thanks to protocols like ActivityPub (the Fediverse), AT Protocol (Bluesky) and Nostr.</p>\n<p><strong>But for the purposes of this post I’ll call them all “cozyweb”,</strong> partly to keep things simple, but mainly because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI4Communities need to works for everyone, because it needs scale — something it currently lacks, as explored below;</li>\n<li>they have something very significant in common: their manageable size and/or federated structure makes it easier for inhabitants to establish and enforce community norms, making community management possible, as <em>“it’s fundamentally impossible to do good content moderation or conversation at a scale of billions… A town square operates at a certain size, not at a global scale” (</em><a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/07/could-social-media-support-healthy-online-conversations-new_public-is-working-on-it\">Could social media support healthy online conversations?</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Small doesn’t mean insular</h4>\n<p>Which is not to say they’re isolated: while each cozyweb community has its own content moderation policies tuned to its needs, most can be networked together without sacrificing independence.</p>\n<p>So while each cozyweb can be a village — “<em>small, most people know each other and you all share a common interest in keeping the sidewalks tidy</em>” — each can build federated roads to many others, including bigger ones “<em>crowded with people, plenty of them sleazy and more than the occasional sidewalk madman… But you’ll always discover something or someone new there. Every second person’s selling something, but one in 20 is selling what you need. Besides, you’re selling too…</em>” (<a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/welcome-to-the-fediverse-starry-eyed-noob-twittermigration-day-3-57b99350414\">Welcome to the Fediverse, starry-eyed noob</a>).</p>\n<p>Just as each Cozyweb community chooses its own “village rules”, with AI4Communities it manages its own AIs to support the community: some help users with content discovery while guarding the village gates against trolls and trash, for example, while others support community moderation and collaboration processes. </p>\n<p>So if small <em>is</em> beautiful, why is everyone trapping each other on a few massive, genuinely awful platforms? </p>\n<h3>Who pays?</h3>\n<h4>Must small be poor?</h4>\n<p>Decentralised, federated networks have been around almost as long as Twitter and Facebook (Evan Prodromou’s Identi.ca launched in 2008, while linkbacks, invented to knit blogging conversations together, came much earlier). But although they are growing now, they tiny compared to the closed gardens of surveillance capitalism, at least partly because — unlike their closed counterparts — they lack a business model and so revenue, as I found out the hard way almost a year ago:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Social infrastructure needs to deliver content as a basic minimum. And running that infrastructure takes time, money and professionalism” — <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/all-my-toots-gone-e844f7c5f255\">All my toots gone</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Three Legged Stool authors believe “<em>many VSOPs will likely receive most of their revenue from the communities they serve, similar to how a local newspaper or nonprofit is funded</em>”, and I hope they’re right. Today, however, only a small fraction of most Mastodon users currently donate to cover their server’s costs (anecodotal).</p>\n<h4>AI4Communities: when community monetises AI (not vice versa)</h4>\n<p><strong>People may pay more for a better experience.</strong> An AI owned by the community, which reflects their preferences and adds value in many ways (as explored below) could provide that experience.</p>\n<p>These communities therefore need access to what the Three Legged Stool manifesto calls a “<strong>Friendly Neighborhood Algorithm Store</strong>” — a marketplace where cozyweb villages can purchase, rent or lease AI services.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as I <a href=\"https://myhub.ai/items/faq-how-is-myhubai-free-and-without-ads-what-is-your-business-model\">pointed out</a> in 2020 when I launched myhub.ai, each community could act as a <strong>data union</strong>: rather than just buying or renting  an AI to support their community, they could <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-finance-collective-intelligence-5d17adcce98b\"><strong>own, train and <em>monetise</em> the resulting algorithm</strong></a> to at least help cover the costs of running the community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>training data created by well-managed communities could be the new currency of collective intelligence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I shelved this idea when ChatGPT appeared, the model collapse paper now suggests that the <strong>training data</strong> created by well-managed communities could be the new currency of collective intelligence. </p>\n<p>Forming a data union is just one model: someone else could set up a for-profit instance, a third could let users choose between paying a subscription fee or seeing ads, and so on.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3WBzTFfnFM1bgbiQsV3T3A.png\"></p>\n<p>(caption) <em>Different Fediverse communities offering users different experiences, including AI services sourced from multiple AI marketplaces and individual suppliers.</em></p>\n<p>Note that <strong>the above figure is Fediverse-specific</strong>: Bluesky and Nostr are built differently, so their AI4Communities-powered ecosystems would be structured differently. However both <em>already</em> support algorithm marketplaces, so the underlying idea will be the same... </p>\n<hr>\n<h3><em>... section to be developed(?)</em></h3>\n<p><strong><em>need to know about Bluesky and Nostr:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>structure, approach</li>\n<li>how algorithmic freedom is/will be delivered</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Ideally, the marketplaces would be able to serve all protocols seamlessly, helping create the scale required. </p>\n<p><strong>Because scale is currently missing.</strong> The Fediverse has around 12 million active accounts, Bluesky a little less, with Nostr a very distant third. Most users in these ecosystems are using Twitter and Facebook clones <strong><em>(check)</em></strong>. </p>\n<p>The key question is therefore: would 20–30 million users, using such superficial applications, create enough high-quality training data?</p>\n<h3>Deeper apps, better data</h3>\n<p><strong>What social applications will be both popular and generate valuable AI training data?</strong></p>\n<p>For AI4Communities to work we need social apps which people want to use <em>and</em> which generate high-quality training data. So what services could these “cozyweb AIs” provide, and within what apps? </p>\n<hr>\n<h3><em>... section to be developed(?)</em></h3>\n<p><strong><em>need to know about Bluesky and Nostr:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>how algorithmic freedom is/will be delivered</li>\n<li>possible diversity of applications </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Content discovery services</h4>\n<p>Content discovery is what happens when content you like or needed to see is presented to you. Bluesky and Nostr already provide algorithmic choice, so let’s start with the Fediverse, where users only get three reverse chronological feeds: from everyone you follow; from everyone in your village; and from everyone followed by at least one person in your village. None of these feeds include content from villages which your village does not federate with, which is a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p>Introducing AI4Communities, however, means that each instance can access AIs which can proactively pull in and surface content from across the Fediverse (excluding un-federated servers) of interest to each village inhabitant. These customisable “For You” feeds will be driven by <strong>relevance and trust</strong>, as explored earlier:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uDYUKBayeAMIplXG1m-4KA.png\"></a></p>\n<p>(caption) <em>Concentric trust circles of collective intelligence, from <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b\">Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs</a></em></p>\n<p>So <strong>how is this any different to X, Threads <em>et al</em>? Simple: your village’s algorithm works for you</strong>, not the platform’s owners and advertisers. Don’t want it to optimise your feed for enragement? Tell it not to. Don’t like engagement bait, NSFW comedy or culture war memes? Tell it so. Only interested in a few topics? Let it know.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>your village’s algorithm works for you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if your tastes don’t match the village’s, move to another village. Balancing an individual’s feed parameters with the village’s content moderation rulebook should be a fun problem to tackle, but far from insuperable, as each village can find its own balance. Which brings me to…</p>\n<h4>Content moderation and Governance services</h4>\n<p>Enforcing any online space’s rules on content moderation is a thankless and sometimes hideous task, so the major platforms have already invested fortunes into AI-supported moderation. Open-source LLMs now make it possible to develop something similar for cozyweb spaces.</p>\n<p>Each village’s moderation AI could intervene in many different ways, from nudging members to rephrase a specific post to outright banning another for life. It would also intervene at several stages of content development, from before a member clicks the “Post” button through to the moment a conversation starts overheating.</p>\n<p>Most of all, of course, the AI will constantly learn from the village’s inhabitants what they like and dislike.</p>\n<p>The key to success will be <strong>effective community co-ownership of the village rulebook</strong> which the AI enforces. After all, if you no longer agree with your village’s rules you can move to another one easily, so ensuring everyone has a say in defining its rules is essential for any village to thrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a community working together to train their village AI</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This raises the fascinating possibility of a community working together to train their village AI. Obviously, any member would ideally be able to contest decisions — the conversations around these edge cases could then help fine-tune the rulebook. The AI should take an active role in these conversations, effectively being coached by the community on norms and practices. I suspect the coaching will be bidirectional much of the time.</p>\n<p>Well-run large communities will therefore develop effective content moderator AIs reflecting the community’s values.

Links to the latest and previous versions, if any, are in the footer.</em></p>\n<p>In my last post I highlighted how the authors of the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y\">model collapse paper</a> in <em>Nature</em> pointed out that in the future any data stemming from “<em>genuine human interactions&nbsp;… will be increasingly valuable</em>” for training the next generation of LLMs. Online, there’s nothing more genuinely human than the interactions in a well-managed digital community, so “<em>after greed and short-sightedness floods the commons with low-grade AI content…</em> <strong><em>well-managed online communities of actual human beings [may be] the only place able to provide the sort of data tomorrow’s LLMs will need” (</em></strong><a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-model-collapse-could-revive-authentic-human-communities-e723d8048ef3\">How Model Collapse could revive authentic human communities</a>).</p>\n<p>This supports the <strong>AI4Communities</strong> idea, first outlined in <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4\">A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence</a> in January 2023, which envisions tomorrow’s online denizens thriving in a wide range of <em>“</em><a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4\"><strong><em>small is beautiful communities</em></strong><em>, supported by AIs which the communities themselves own, train and monetise</em></a><em>”</em>, rather than putting up with whatever Meta’s or X’s global, “one size fits all” algorithms inflict on them to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>If model collapse has made AI4Communities more feasible, what is it exactly, how do we get there, and who’s building it? But first, why care?</p>\n<h3>What is the Cozyweb, and why is Small Beautiful?</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://publicinfrastructure.org/2023/03/29/the-three-legged-stool/\">Three Legged Stool manifesto</a>, <strong>“Very Small Online Platforms (VSOPs)”</strong> are <em>“social networks created for a very specific purpose, with rules, norms and affordances appropriate to that community”</em> (<a href=\"https://newpublic.substack.com/p/a-social-network-taxonomy\">A social network taxonomy</a>). While they’re obviously playing with the EU’s term for “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2413\">Very Large Online Platforms</a>”, they see VSOPs as separate from <strong>federated servers</strong>, which combine small size and large reach thanks to protocols like ActivityPub (the Fediverse), AT Protocol (Bluesky) and Nostr.</p>\n<p><strong>But for the purposes of this post I’ll call them all “cozyweb”,</strong> partly to keep things simple, but mainly because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI4Communities need to works for everyone, because it needs scale — something it currently lacks, as explored below;</li>\n<li>they have something very significant in common: their manageable size and/or federated structure makes it easier for inhabitants to establish and enforce community norms, making community management possible, as <em>“it’s fundamentally impossible to do good content moderation or conversation at a scale of billions… A town square operates at a certain size, not at a global scale” (</em><a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/07/could-social-media-support-healthy-online-conversations-new_public-is-working-on-it\">Could social media support healthy online conversations?</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Small doesn’t mean&nbsp;insular</h4>\n<p>Which is not to say they’re isolated: while each cozyweb community has its own content moderation policies tuned to its needs, most can be networked together without sacrificing independence.</p>\n<p>So while each cozyweb can be a village — “<em>small, most people know each other and you all share a common interest in keeping the sidewalks tidy</em>” — each can build federated roads to many others, including bigger ones “<em>crowded with people, plenty of them sleazy and more than the occasional sidewalk madman… But you’ll always discover something or someone new there. Every second person’s selling something, but one in 20 is selling what you need. Besides, you’re selling too…</em>” (<a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/welcome-to-the-fediverse-starry-eyed-noob-twittermigration-day-3-57b99350414\">Welcome to the Fediverse, starry-eyed noob</a>).</p>\n<p>Just as each Cozyweb community chooses its own “village rules”, with AI4Communities it manages its own AIs to support the community: some help users with content discovery while guarding the village gates against trolls and trash, for example, while others support community moderation and collaboration processes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So if small <em>is</em> beautiful, why is everyone trapping each other on a few massive, genuinely awful platforms?&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Who pays?</h3>\n<h4>Must small be&nbsp;poor?</h4>\n<p>Decentralised, federated networks have been around almost as long as Twitter and Facebook (Evan Prodromou’s Identi.ca launched in 2008, while linkbacks, invented to knit blogging conversations together, came much earlier). But although they are growing now, they tiny compared to the closed gardens of surveillance capitalism, at least partly because — unlike their closed counterparts — they lack a business model and so revenue, as I found out the hard way almost a year ago:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Social infrastructure needs to deliver content as a basic minimum. And running that infrastructure takes time, money and professionalism” — <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/all-my-toots-gone-e844f7c5f255\">All my toots gone</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Three Legged Stool authors believe “<em>many VSOPs will likely receive most of their revenue from the communities they serve, similar to how a local newspaper or nonprofit is funded</em>”, and I hope they’re right. Today, however, only a small fraction of most Mastodon users currently donate to cover their server’s costs (anecodotal).</p>\n<h4>AI4Communities: when community monetises AI (not vice&nbsp;versa)</h4>\n<p><strong>People may pay more for a better experience.</strong> An AI owned by the community, which reflects their preferences and adds value in many ways (as explored below) could provide that experience.</p>\n<p>These communities therefore need access to what the Three Legged Stool manifesto calls a “<strong>Friendly Neighborhood Algorithm Store</strong>” — a marketplace where cozyweb villages can purchase, rent or lease AI services.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as I <a href=\"https://myhub.ai/items/faq-how-is-myhubai-free-and-without-ads-what-is-your-business-model\">pointed out</a> in 2020 when I launched myhub.ai, each community could act as a <strong>data union</strong>: rather than just buying or renting  an AI to support their community, they could <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-finance-collective-intelligence-5d17adcce98b\"><strong>own, train and <em>monetise</em> the resulting algorithm</strong></a> to at least help cover the costs of running the community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>training data created by well-managed communities could be the new currency of collective intelligence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I shelved this idea when ChatGPT appeared, the model collapse paper now suggests that the <strong>training data</strong> created by well-managed communities could be the new currency of collective intelligence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Forming a data union is just one model: someone else could set up a for-profit instance, a third could let users choose between paying a subscription fee or seeing ads, and so on.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3WBzTFfnFM1bgbiQsV3T3A.png\"></p>\n<p>(caption) <em>Different Fediverse communities offering users different experiences, including AI services sourced from multiple AI marketplaces and individual suppliers.</em></p>\n<p>Note that <strong>the above figure is Fediverse-specific</strong>: Bluesky and Nostr are built differently, so their AI4Communities-powered ecosystems would be structured differently. However both <em>already</em> support algorithm marketplaces, so the underlying idea will be the same... </p>\n<hr>\n<h3><em>... section to be developed(?)</em></h3>\n<p><strong><em>need to know about Bluesky and Nostr:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>structure, approach</li>\n<li>how algorithmic freedom is/will be delivered</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Ideally, the marketplaces would be able to serve all protocols seamlessly, helping create the scale required.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Because scale is currently missing.</strong> The Fediverse has around 12 million active accounts, Bluesky a little less, with Nostr a very distant third. Most users in these ecosystems are using Twitter and Facebook clones <strong><em>(check)</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key question is therefore: would 20–30 million users, using such superficial applications, create enough high-quality training data?</p>\n<h3>Deeper apps, better&nbsp;data</h3>\n<p><strong>What social applications will be both popular and generate valuable AI training data?</strong></p>\n<p>For AI4Communities to work we need social apps which people want to use <em>and</em> which generate high-quality training data. So what services could these “cozyweb AIs” provide, and within what apps?&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><em>... section to be developed(?)</em></h3>\n<p><strong><em>need to know about Bluesky and Nostr:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>how algorithmic freedom is/will be delivered</li>\n<li>possible diversity of applications </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Content discovery services</h4>\n<p>Content discovery is what happens when content you like or needed to see is presented to you. Bluesky and Nostr already provide algorithmic choice, so let’s start with the Fediverse, where users only get three reverse chronological feeds: from everyone you follow; from everyone in your village; and from everyone followed by at least one person in your village. None of these feeds include content from villages which your village does not federate with, which is a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p>Introducing AI4Communities, however, means that each instance can access AIs which can proactively pull in and surface content from across the Fediverse (excluding un-federated servers) of interest to each village inhabitant. These customisable “For You” feeds will be driven by <strong>relevance and trust</strong>, as explored earlier:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uDYUKBayeAMIplXG1m-4KA.png\"></a></p>\n<p>(caption) <em>Concentric trust circles of collective intelligence, from <a href=\"https://mathewlowry.medium.com/building-collective-intelligence-from-social-knowledge-graphs-e3a465852e8b\">Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs</a></em></p>\n<p>So <strong>how is this any different to X, Threads <em>et al</em>? Simple: your village’s algorithm works for you</strong>, not the platform’s owners and advertisers. Don’t want it to optimise your feed for enragement? Tell it not to. Don’t like engagement bait, NSFW comedy or culture war memes? Tell it so. Only interested in a few topics? Let it know.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>your village’s algorithm works for&nbsp;you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if your tastes don’t match the village’s, move to another village. Balancing an individual’s feed parameters with the village’s content moderation rulebook should be a fun problem to tackle, but far from insuperable, as each village can find its own balance. Which brings me to…</p>\n<h4>Content moderation and Governance services</h4>\n<p>Enforcing any online space’s rules on content moderation is a thankless and sometimes hideous task, so the major platforms have already invested fortunes into AI-supported moderation. Open-source LLMs now make it possible to develop something similar for cozyweb spaces.</p>\n<p>Each village’s moderation AI could intervene in many different ways, from nudging members to rephrase a specific post to outright banning another for life. It would also intervene at several stages of content development, from before a member clicks the “Post” button through to the moment a conversation starts overheating.</p>\n<p>Most of all, of course, the AI will constantly learn from the village’s inhabitants what they like and dislike.</p>\n<p>The key to success will be <strong>effective community co-ownership of the village rulebook</strong> which the AI enforces. After all, if you no longer agree with your village’s rules you can move to another one easily, so ensuring everyone has a say in defining its rules is essential for any village to thrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a community working together to train their village&nbsp;AI</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This raises the fascinating possibility of a community working together to train their village AI. Obviously, any member would ideally be able to contest decisions — the conversations around these edge cases could then help fine-tune the rulebook. The AI should take an active role in these conversations, effectively being coached by the community on norms and practices. I suspect the coaching will be bidirectional much of the time.</p>\n<p>Well-run large communities will therefore develop effective content moderator AIs reflecting the community’s values. The data used to create these AI will be valuable, as will the AIs themselves.</p>\n<h4>Collaboration support&nbsp;services</h4>\n<p><strong>Chatting with strangers and making friends on a social media platform is only a small part of collective intelligence.</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to take things further and co-create something together with a group, you have a problem — hardly any social media platform offers integrated collaboration tools (exception: Reddit’s community wikis).</p>\n<p>Which is why you need to agree, <em>as a group</em>, on a collaborative tool everyone is comfortable with (TL:DR; it doesn’t exist for groups larger than 4), and then co-create on one platform while chatting on the other.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure why this is so.

What needs to happen next? \nThe version you're reading now is an early draft: I am publishing this using the permanent versions pattern - where I publish a string of versions as I develop my thoughts - because I'm hoping constructive reactions to early drafts like these will help me answer my questions and so finish the post. Links to the latest and previous versions, if any, are in the footer.\nIn my last post I highlighted how the authors of the model collapse paper in Nature pointed out that in the future any data stemming from “genuine human interactions … will be increasingly valuable” for training the next generation of LLMs. Online, there’s nothing more genuinely human than the interactions in a well-managed digital community, so “after greed and short-sightedness floods the commons with low-grade AI content… well-managed online communities of actual human beings [may be] the only place able to provide the sort of data tomorrow’s LLMs will need” (How Model Collapse could revive authentic human communities).\nThis supports the AI4Communities idea, first outlined in A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence in January 2023, which envisions tomorrow’s online denizens thriving in a wide range of “small is beautiful communities, supported by AIs which the communities themselves own, train and monetise”, rather than putting up with whatever Meta’s or X’s global, “one size fits all” algorithms inflict on them to turn a profit.\nIf model collapse has made AI4Communities more feasible, what is it exactly, how do we get there, and who’s building it? But first, why care?\nWhat is the Cozyweb, and why is Small Beautiful?\nAccording to the Three Legged Stool manifesto, “Very Small Online Platforms (VSOPs)” are “social networks created for a very specific purpose, with rules, norms and affordances appropriate to that community” (A social network taxonomy). While they’re obviously playing with the EU’s term for “Very Large Online Platforms”, they see VSOPs as separate from federated servers, which combine small size and large reach thanks to protocols like ActivityPub (the Fediverse), AT Protocol (Bluesky) and Nostr.\nBut for the purposes of this post I’ll call them all “cozyweb”, partly to keep things simple, but mainly because:\n\nAI4Communities need to works for everyone, because it needs scale — something it currently lacks, as explored below;\nthey have something very significant in common: their manageable size and/or federated structure makes it easier for inhabitants to establish and enforce community norms, making community management possible, as “it’s fundamentally impossible to do good content moderation or conversation at a scale of billions… A town square operates at a certain size, not at a global scale” (Could social media support healthy online conversations?)\n\nSmall doesn’t mean insular\nWhich is not to say they’re isolated: while each cozyweb community has its own content moderation policies tuned to its needs, most can be networked together without sacrificing independence.\nSo while each cozyweb can be a village — “small, most people know each other and you all share a common interest in keeping the sidewalks tidy” — each can build federated roads to many others, including bigger ones “crowded with people, plenty of them sleazy and more than the occasional sidewalk madman… But you’ll always discover something or someone new there. Every second person’s selling something, but one in 20 is selling what you need. Besides, you’re selling too…” (Welcome to the Fediverse, starry-eyed noob).\nJust as each Cozyweb community chooses its own “village rules”, with AI4Communities it manages its own AIs to support the community: some help users with content discovery while guarding the village gates against trolls and trash, for example, while others support community moderation and collaboration processes. \nSo if small is beautiful, why is everyone trapping each other on a few massive, genuinely awful platforms? \nWho pays?\nMust small be poor?\nDecentralised, federated networks have been around almost as long as Twitter and Facebook (Evan Prodromou’s Identi.ca launched in 2008, while linkbacks, invented to knit blogging conversations together, came much earlier). But although they are growing now, they tiny compared to the closed gardens of surveillance capitalism, at least partly because — unlike their closed counterparts — they lack a business model and so revenue, as I found out the hard way almost a year ago:\n\n“Social infrastructure needs to deliver content as a basic minimum. And running that infrastructure takes time, money and professionalism” — All my toots gone\n\nThe Three Legged Stool authors believe “many VSOPs will likely receive most of their revenue from the communities they serve, similar to how a local newspaper or nonprofit is funded”, and I hope they’re right. Today, however, only a small fraction of most Mastodon users currently donate to cover their server’s costs (anecodotal).\nAI4Communities: when community monetises AI (not vice versa)\nPeople may pay more for a better experience. An AI owned by the community, which reflects their preferences and adds value in many ways (as explored below) could provide that experience.\nThese communities therefore need access to what the Three Legged Stool manifesto calls a “Friendly Neighborhood Algorithm Store” — a marketplace where cozyweb villages can purchase, rent or lease AI services.\nMoreover, as I pointed out in 2020 when I launched myhub.ai, each community could act as a data union: rather than just buying or renting  an AI to support their community, they could own, train and monetise the resulting algorithm to at least help cover the costs of running the community.\n\ntraining data created by well-managed communities could be the new currency of collective intelligence\n\nWhile I shelved this idea when ChatGPT appeared, the model collapse paper now suggests that the training data created by well-managed communities could be the new currency of collective intelligence. \nForming a data union is just one model: someone else could set up a for-profit instance, a third could let users choose between paying a subscription fee or seeing ads, and so on.\n\n(caption) Different Fediverse communities offering users different experiences, including AI services sourced from multiple AI marketplaces and individual suppliers.\nNote that the above figure is Fediverse-specific: Bluesky and Nostr are built differently, so their AI4Communities-powered ecosystems would be structured differently. However both already support algorithm marketplaces, so the underlying idea will be the same... \n\n... section to be developed(?)\nneed to know about Bluesky and Nostr:\n\nstructure, approach\nhow algorithmic freedom is/will be delivered\n\n\nIdeally, the marketplaces would be able to serve all protocols seamlessly, helping create the scale required. \nBecause scale is currently missing. The Fediverse has around 12 million active accounts, Bluesky a little less, with Nostr a very distant third. Most users in these ecosystems are using Twitter and Facebook clones (check). \nThe key question is therefore: would 20–30 million users, using such superficial applications, create enough high-quality training data?\nDeeper apps, better data\nWhat social applications will be both popular and generate valuable AI training data?\nFor AI4Communities to work we need social apps which people want to use and which generate high-quality training data. So what services could these “cozyweb AIs” provide, and within what apps? \n\n... section to be developed(?)\nneed to know about Bluesky and Nostr:\n\nhow algorithmic freedom is/will be delivered\npossible diversity of applications \n\n\nContent discovery services\nContent discovery is what happens when content you like or needed to see is presented to you. Bluesky and Nostr already provide algorithmic choice, so let’s start with the Fediverse, where users only get three reverse chronological feeds: from everyone you follow; from everyone in your village; and from everyone followed by at least one person in your village. None of these feeds include content from villages which your village does not federate with, which is a feature, not a bug.\nIntroducing AI4Communities, however, means that each instance can access AIs which can proactively pull in and surface content from across the Fediverse (excluding un-federated servers) of interest to each village inhabitant. These customisable “For You” feeds will be driven by relevance and trust, as explored earlier:\n\n(caption) Concentric trust circles of collective intelligence, from Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs\nSo how is this any different to X, Threads et al? Simple: your village’s algorithm works for you, not the platform’s owners and advertisers. Don’t want it to optimise your feed for enragement? Tell it not to. Don’t like engagement bait, NSFW comedy or culture war memes? Tell it so. Only interested in a few topics? Let it know.\n\nyour village’s algorithm works for you\n\nAnd if your tastes don’t match the village’s, move to another village. Balancing an individual’s feed parameters with the village’s content moderation rulebook should be a fun problem to tackle, but far from insuperable, as each village can find its own balance. Which brings me to…\nContent moderation and Governance services\nEnforcing any online space’s rules on content moderation is a thankless and sometimes hideous task, so the major platforms have already invested fortunes into AI-supported moderation. Open-source LLMs now make it possible to develop something similar for cozyweb spaces.\nEach village’s moderation AI could intervene in many different ways, from nudging members to rephrase a specific post to outright banning another for life. It would also intervene at several stages of content development, from before a member clicks the “Post” button through to the moment a conversation starts overheating.\nMost of all, of course, the AI will constantly learn from the village’s inhabitants what they like and dislike.\nThe key to success will be effective community co-ownership of the village rulebook which the AI enforces. After all, if you no longer agree with your village’s rules you can move to another one easily, so ensuring everyone has a say in defining its rules is essential for any village to thrive.\n\na community working together to train their village AI\n\nThis raises the fascinating possibility of a community working together to train their village AI. Obviously, any member would ideally be able to contest decisions — the conversations around these edge cases could then help fine-tune the rulebook. The AI should take an active role in these conversations, effectively being coached by the community on norms and practices. I suspect the coaching will be bidirectional much of the time.\nWell-run large communities will therefore develop effective content moderator AIs reflecting the community’s values. The data used to create these AI will be valuable, as will the AIs themselves.\nCollaboration support services\nChatting with strangers and making friends on a social media platform is only a small part of collective intelligence.\nIf you want to take things further and co-create something together with a group, you have a problem — hardly any social media platform offers integrated collaboration tools (exception: Reddit’s community wikis).\nWhich is why you need to agree, as a group, on a collaborative tool everyone is comfortable with (TL:DR; it doesn’t exist for groups larger than 4), and then co-create on one platform while chatting on the other.\nI’m not sure why this is so. Work-oriented collaboration platforms offer reasonably seamless chat and collaboration environments. In the public realm, however, there seems to be a stubborn divide separating wikis and other groupware from blogging and social media.\nI explored one solution almost 4 years ago in Thinking and writing in a decentralised collective intelligence ecosystem. \n\nA social ecosystem where users can seamlessly collaborate\n\nThis video introduces the idea of a social ecosystem where users can seamlessly collaborate before exploring massive.wiki, an early example of what the collaborative part of the overall technology stack might look like:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfYl3SiZJWU\nA social ecosystem where users can seamlessly collaborate is a worthy goal in itself. Moreover, that collaborative work can be supported by your village’s AI (given consent from the group), which means these collaborations become another source of high-value AI training data.\nBetter apps\nAs mentioned above, Bluesky and Nostr already offer some elements of the infrastructure required for this: one of my favourite Bluesky feeds, for example, is “Science”, developed by Dani cRabaiotti, a zoologist and data scientist working at the Zoological Society in London. I’m less familiar with Nostr, but I know that Jack Dorsey, its founder and the guy who launched Bluesky when he ran Twitter, definitely believes in algorithmic choice.\nBut Bluesky, as well as most of the Nostr and Fediverse apps, are Twitter look-alikes. \n\n... section to be developed(?)\nneed to know about Bluesky and Nostr:\n\nam I talking out of my rear end?\n\n\nMy gut feeling is that for AI4communities to work in privacy-first spaces like these, the apps people use will need to be less superficial to generate higher-quality training data. After all, there’s only so much value in short status updates, and noone's proposing following users around the web, siphoning up their data to sell to marketers as Facebook et al do.\n\nthere’s only so much value in short status updates\n\nFor one example of how that could look, A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence suggests combining publishing tools (blogs, social posts), social bookmarking and personal knowledge management, and networking them together across federated networks, all supported by your personal AI. Because then your AI will be able to can learn from:\n\nwhat you do on your social network(s)\nevery article you bookmark or Hub (and so find really, really useful)\nthe notes you make about it as you curate it (which tells the AI exactly what you find useful about it)\neverything else (blog posts and professional references, mainly) which you publish alongside them\nand everything else in your private knowledge library you make accessible to it.\n\nThat’s a lot of tightly interconnected knowledge, all reflecting your interests and expertise. Any AI sourcing that sort of knowledgebase will perform content discovery superbly well for you. And that AI is also being trained by everyone else in your village, with whom you presumably share some interests and values. Together the community will generate extremely valuable AI training data, due to the authentically human curation and creation processes involved in making it.\nA Brave, early inspiration\nThere is already evidence for this strategy on the market in a parallel field: search. \nIn May 2023 Brave Software, creators of the privacy-first eponymous browser and search engine, released Brave Search API. Via this service, AI developers can access the training dataset Brave developed through both Brave Search and their Web Discovery Project, which allows Brave browser users to contribute anonymous data about the pages they’re actually visiting.\nAs a result, Brave’s training data “is much more representative of the Web people actually care about”, without the huge morass of “junk sites — spam, dead links, duplicates, and more” one finds when crawling the Web at large. And that was written before the Web started filling up with AI-generated content, which is even worse for training AI.\nAI4Communities is the social media equivalent of Brave’s approach to search. Both revolve around authenticity-driven data quality:\n\nPeople do not actually spend a lot of time browsing junk content, so Brave’s dataset doesn’t have any, and so is of higher quality\nPeople in well-run communities do not curate, share and collaborate on rubbish content, so the data they create will be valuable, too.\n\n\nConclusions\n... section to be rewritten(?)\nLooking back over this post, I can see that it’s heavily influenced by my greater familiarity with the Fediverse than Bluesky or Nostr.
