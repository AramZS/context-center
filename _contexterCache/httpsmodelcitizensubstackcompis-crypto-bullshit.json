This obviously isn’t in any sense scientific, but it accords with my vague impression, which is why I was braced for some “polite but hostile” feedback, which was duly received. In the comments, subscriber Trevor Austin, a software engineer who surely knows more about this than I do, writes:</p><blockquote><p>I did some dabbling in Solidity two years ago when my company explored a crypto moonshot slash ICO cash grab, and I came away thinking there's mostly no there there… If anything I've become even more bearish since about smart contracts and web3 watching the NFT hype cycle blossom. Are there *any* problems solved by blockchains that aren't better handled by a nonprofit org with a good charter and a mysql database?</p></blockquote><p>I’ve heard endless versions of the “What problem does this solve!?” plaint ever since delving into this world of mystery and wonder.

This is a <em>very </em>common sentiment. Indeed, within my social/intellectual circles, the <em>dominant</em> view seems to be that Bitcoin amounts to <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/bitcoin-nfts-other-crypto-fads-are-destroying-our-planet-n1261139\" rel=\"\">climate terrorism</a> in the service of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/bitcoin-is-the-tulipmania-that-refuses-to-die\" rel=\"\">tulip mania</a>, that <a href=\"https://every.to/napkin-math/nft-projects-are-just-mlms-for-tech-elites\" rel=\"\">NFTs are a pyramid scheme</a>, and the main crypto use case is crime-enabling asset concealment and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/global-money-laundering-watchdog-says-uh-yeah-better-1847956545\" rel=\"\">money laundering</a>.  The prevalence of this view spells trouble for the prospects of apposite regulatory forbearance and care. Which is a problem if it turns out that there’s a there there.     </p><p>Now, I’m sensitive and sympathetic to the “<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgzed/what-the-hell-is-right-clicker-mentality\" rel=\"\">right-clicker</a>” view because, well, I’m sure there’s more than a little money laundering, uninternalized climate externalities, greater-fool pyramid scheming, and frothy speculation in cryptoland. It’s not great, and it’s totally worth taking seriously. Until recently, I was skeptical of the whole deal, too. </p><p>However, a few of my best and smartest friends are <em>deeply</em> into crypto stuff and know more about it than I do. One of my personal epistemic precepts is that if I disagree with somebody who is (a) at least smart as I am, (b) has generally sound judgment <em>and </em>(c) is better informed on a subject, then I ought to concede that I’m probably wrong and revise my opinion in their direction. The trouble is, I also know plenty of people who satisfy all these conditions but think crypto is unmitigated bullshit. That is to say, we’ve got a rare instance of not-obviously-political intra-smart polarization on our hands! Or, as I tweeted a while back:</p><div class=\"tweet\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1458687247444635648&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Either an amazing number of smart people are getting snookered or an amazing number of smart people are uninformed and unimaginative &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;willwilkinson&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Will Wilkinson 🌐&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Nov 11 06:45:15 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I've been reading and chatting with people in hopes of understanding why so many game companies are acting so excited about blockchain and every single answer seems to be \\&quot;This is the future of the industry but we don't know why\\&quot; (this one is from an earnings call) https://t.co/9EFMP5XGS3&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;jasonschreier&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jason Schreier&quot;},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:4,&quot;like_count&quot;:51,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1458687247444635648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"><div class=\"tweet-header\"><img class=\"tweet-user-avatar\" src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/willwilkinson.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter avatar for @willwilkinson\"><span class=\"tweet-author-name\">Will Wilkinson 🌐 </span><span class=\"tweet-author\">@willwilkinson</span></div>Either an amazing number of smart people are getting snookered or an amazing number of smart people are uninformed and unimaginative <div class=\"quoted-tweet\"><p><span class=\"quote-tweet-name\">Jason Schreier </span><span class=\"quote-tweet-username\">@jasonschreier</span></p>I've been reading and chatting with people in hopes of understanding why so many game companies are acting so excited about blockchain and every single answer seems to be \"This is the future of the industry but we don't know why\" (this one is from an earnings call) https://t.co/9EFMP5XGS3</div></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1458687247444635648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"><div class=\"tweet-footer\"><p class=\"tweet-date\">November 11th 2021</p><span class=\"retweets\"><span class=\"rt-count\">4</span> Retweets</span><span class=\"likes\"><span class=\"like-count\">51</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>What’s a virtuous Bayesian to do? I figure you either adopt the Pyrrhonian skeptical stance, suspend judgment, set your <em>p</em> at .5 and go Swiss… <em>or </em>you<em> </em>get more information. <em> </em>For my part, I want to know whether I’m a doofus for putting a modest amount of money into Ether. At one level, I'd like to just shrug and say “guess we’ll find out” sooner or later. At another level, I’d really like to know whether I ought to buy, sell or hold.  Rational agnosticism isn’t much help in balancing your portfolio. So I went with <em>get</em> <em>more information</em> and started bingeing crypto podcasts. </p><p>Right away I noticed something essential about polarized attitudes about crypto: it’s driven to a large extent by vexed will-to-obliviousness on one side and self-dealing, book-talking, investment-pumping, hand-waving performative optimism on the other. </p><p>Once you get up to speed on the basics (which honestly takes a fair amount of work) it’s plain that a lot of crypto skepticism is little more than annoyance over the constant encroachment of baffling, unwanted crypto news into the ambit of one’s awareness. Michael Chabon’s reply (happens all the time, nbd) to a recent tweet of mine about mainstream under-coverage of the weirdness of the NFT craze captures something central to crypto discourse:</p><div class=\"tweet\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/michaelchabon/status/1461211066017497091&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Embarrassed to admit I’ve never understood anything less than I understand NFTs and why they matter.  *Anti-Oedipus*.

Now, I don’t know if Chabon’s crypto-skeptical or -hostile or anything like that. But the idea that crypto topics <em>repel attention</em>, but seem to keep demanding it from us nevertheless, gets at something essential about the mood of widespread exasperation and antagonism around crypto. A lot of us just don’t understand it, don’t want to understand it, and wish people would just shut up about it. That’s sort of how I felt before diving in head-first — though, like Chabon, I was a bit ashamed about not wanting to understand it. </p><p>Anyway, if that’s your attitude, and you encounter what looks to you to like relatively informed anti-crypto commentary, you’ll be tempted to latch on to it uncritically to justify resistance to learning anything about it. The urge to rationalize tuning out is surely amplified by the fact that laser-eyed online crypto bros are insufferable dicks. But it’s not simply that they’re insufferable. It’s also that a bunch of them are getting ridiculously rich, which is insufferably insufferable, and raises the anxious specter of FOMO to boot. There’s real comfort in the idea that crypto’s nothing but a faddish planet-wrecking house-of-cards scam; it’s a buffer against nagging FOMO, regret, or a sense of obligation to learn something — a fate which might beset us were we to suspect that this stuff <em>could be</em> legit, genuinely innovative, and part of a transformative technological, financial, and cultural paradigm-shift.</p><p>On the pro-crypto side, however, we’ve got totally deranged confidence that the future will be built on the blockchain and run on cryptocurrency. The first thing you learn when you start listening to crypto podcasts is that people don’t do them because they’re duly skeptical and rigorously neutral about Bitcoin. They do them because they’ve bought in and are super-excited about the torrid growth of their crypto investments. They’re all, in one way or another, talking their book. </p><p>So where does this leave an honest dealer keen to cash in on the future but not so keen on getting duped? Well, you obviously can’t trust the negative Nancies dug into derisive ignorance as defense against FOMO. I mean, they <em>proudly</em> admit that they don’t know what they’re talking about. But you also can’t trust the exhausting monorail-salesman <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wagmi\" rel=\"\">WAGMI</a> hype.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif\" width=\"480\" height=\"362\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1901656,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\"></a></figure></div><p>My general rule about subject in which I haven’t developed significant independent knowledge is simply to believe whatever the consensus of credible experts happens to be. That’s easier said than done in this case, because it’s tough to say what expertise or credibility looks like when there’s a hot dispute about the legitimacy of the entire domain. When the conditions for non-question-begging expert identification break down, there’s not a lot you can do other than to “do my own research,” fully aware of the pitfalls, and try to come to some reasonable conclusions on your own steam.

You should browse through it. I promise you’ll learn something.   </p><p>Anyway, what I did to get started was learn to use <a href=\"https://metamask.io/\" rel=\"\">Metamask</a> and buy some NFTs. Not some silly jpg cartoon avatar, mind you, but stuff that seemed to me more useful and functional. I bought an Ethereum Name Service domain, willwilkinson.eth. It makes it super-easy for people to send me money without knowing my public address. (You should try it!) It also <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=willwilkinson.eth\" rel=\"\">makes it easy</a> for anybody to see <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0257141c5ed5b522c2ca19f0f7fe5eeb65768e6\" rel=\"\">every transaction involving the connected wallet</a>. So, for example, you can see that I bought some shitty Axies in <a href=\"https://axieinfinity.com/\" rel=\"\">Axie Infinity </a>, which I used to get my ass kicked repeatedly by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/people-in-philippines-earn-cryptocurrency-playing-nft-video-game-axie-infinity.html\" rel=\"\">semi-pro Filipinos</a>. You know what? It doesn’t feel like bullshit. </p><p>This is when it really started to click to me. I’m not actually interested in fighting and breeding cute virtual creatures. But experiencing an in-game economy built to integrate with the real economy was eye-opening. Felix plays Roblox and loves to customize his avatar, collect pets, and special items his dude can carry around. He’d love to be able to literally own these things, buy and sell them, and cash out at the click of a button. But that kind of game application is just the most obvious type of thing blockchains makes easier. </p><p>Presently, the dominant blockchain/Web 3.0 application is decentralized finance, but I think it’s easier to see the value of where things are heading, and to allay worries about hype cycles, pyramid schemes and speculative bubbles, if we look past the purely financial stuff. Once you start to dig into some of the applications that venture capitalists have been plowing truckloads of old-fashioned American dollars into, you run into various kinds of decentralized networks built out and maintained by tokenized incentives. When you read about them, the value proposition makes a lot of sense. </p><p>So, for example, you have things like <a href=\"https://filecoin.io/\" rel=\"\">Filecoin</a>, which describes itself as “an open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and incentive layer.” What does that mean? It means you can set up a data center in your garage and get paid in the network currency for reliably storing and serving data. Or consider <a href=\"https://rendertoken.com/\" rel=\"\">Render</a>, which does “distributed GPU rending on the blockchain.” That is to say, it incentivizes people to rent out GPU processing for graphics rendering. Or take <a href=\"https://www.helium.com/mine\" rel=\"\">Helium</a>, which seeks to create a wireless network  for IoT/Internet of Things sensors and smart devices by incentivizing people to install certain types of radio transmitters and keeping them running. </p><p>Obviously, things like Amazon Web Services and wireless networks already exist. But blockchain incentives, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts can do it all in a fundamentally different, more decentralized way. Once I saw that this decentralization has a variety of technical, economic, and political advantages, it became started to become clear to me that there’s definitely a there there. More than that, I started to see that it’s probably pretty <em>good </em>there<em>— </em>that we should <em>want to go to there</em>, as TV’s Liz Lemon liked to say. </p><p>In particular, I find the diffuse capitalization, ownership, and control of these kinds of networks extremely appealing. It’s this — not stupid ape avatars or hype about Bitcoin as “digital gold” — that gets me charged up about crypto/blockchain stuff. It’s also why think we need to be careful about regulation that could strangle the baby in the crib. It’s not bullshit. It looks to me like it <em>could</em> be a way back to the beautifully decentralized freedom of Web 1.0. </p><p>Think about who owns the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks. Nobody does. Nobody owns them. These networks are made up of many thousands of machines whose computational power has been allocated to the network because the network’s constitutive code pays the people who own the machines to keep them connected and churning away — and on super-reliable, coded-in terms that can’t be whimsically revised. </p><p>Replicating everything AWS or Azure or Google Cloud can do on a blockchain isn’t redundant because the decentralized collective “ownership” and governance of blockchain networks supports security, privacy, stability, and scalability features that Web 2.0 applications running on centralized corporate clouds can’t replicate <em>because </em>they are centralized and control is concentrated. </p><p>This kind of decentralization has pretty radical distributive implications. When there is nobody at the top, nobody at the top can hoard the value generated by the network. The economic surplus generated by this kind of network is <em>necessarily </em>distributed to the community of miners, stakers, and users because that’s what brings them into existence, keeps them going and lends them value. The diffusion of economic surplus is part of the basic architecture of the system. Market structure, distributive principles, and defenses against network domination are all baked into the code. </p><p>In my opinion, a technological/economic/institutional architecture that can coordinate economic activity in a way that makes the firm superfluous, deconcentrates ownership and control over vital networks, and broadly distributes economic surplus to network participants according to transparent, fair and relatively fixed rules, <em>is </em>the killer app. This can hard to see because the principal value of the underlying technical innovation is economic, organizational, and, ultimately, political. The consumer-facing technology that can be built on top of is genuinely exciting, but secondary. Naturally enough, this was all <em>impossible </em>for me to see before I started to seriously dabble, which made me genuinely curious about how it all works and finally drove me to read a number of extremely dry but profoundly informative white papers. </p><p>For now, I’m sold. I think there’s a there there. I honestly think blockchain <em>can</em> change the world — and for the better. Which, I’m sorry to say, makes it pretty hard to shut up about it. My sincerest apologies to all for whom the entire subject is “coated in oil of tedium,” especially my beloved and longsuffering wife.  </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscribe-widget \"><form action=\"/api/v1/free?nojs=true\" method=\"post\" noValidate class=\"form \"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"first_url\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"first_referrer\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"current_url\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"current_referrer\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"referral_code\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"source\" value=\"subscribe-widget\" /><div class=\"sideBySideWrap\"><input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email…\" /><button tabIndex=\"0\" class=\"button rightButton  primary subscribe-btn\" type=\"submit\"><b class=\"button-text \">Subscribe</b></button></div><div id=\"error-container\"></div><div class=\"subtle-help-text below-input\"></div></form></div><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comments\" rel=\"\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p></div></div><div></div><div class=\"post-footer\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"post-meta big alternative-meta custom\"><tr><td class=\"post-meta-item icon\"><a href=\"https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comments\" class=\"post-meta-button button\"><svg role=\"img\" style=\"height: 14px;

But this is not a very convincing piece because you don't actually address the damning technical problems that well-informed critics of blockchain technology point to, perhaps because- as you candidly admit- this is a subject that's well outside your own area of expertise.</span></p><p><span>But the technical details are kind of the point. If you start from the assumption that &quot;blockchain incentives, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts can do it all in a fundamentally different, more decentralized way&quot; then yes, obviously that's a big deal. But the question is whether that's true! And there's very good reason to think it isn't.</span></p><p><span>If we take the example of Bitcoin specifically, people have been making all of the exact same promises about radical decentralization and mass adoption for more than a decade now, but- at least in the narrow case of Bitcoin- it's all complete horseshit.</span></p><p><span>Economies of scale meant that mining became extremely centralized early on, and a handful of men (I believe they're all men) now control the overwhelming majority of all mining power, meaning that Bitcoin is not actually &quot;trustless&quot; in any real sense. So, uh, why not just have those same guys run a database that keeps track of who owns which Bitcoins and save us all ~180TWh of electricity every year?</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile mass adoption is a practical impossibility because the whole system has a *hard theoretical limit* of ten transactions per second (it's about half that in actual practice). For comparison, the Visa network does about 1,700 transactions per second and could hypothetically do many more. Bitcoin boosters are generally either not aware of this inconvenient fact, or will gesture wildly in the direction of some piece of vaporware (like the much-hyped and utterly harebrained Lightning Network) that's always just a few years away. And this is not some hypothetical future problem! The network *already* ground to halt in 2017, with hundreds of thousands of unconfirmed transactions getting stuck in limbo, and has largely ceased to function as an actual payment system since then.</span></p><p><span>And the truly wild thing is that none of this mattered for the price of Bitcoin! The price just kept going up even as it became clear that the network is fundamentally broken! It was almost as though the technology was never really the point, anymore than the specific qualities of the tulips or the Beanie Babies were the point in past speculative manias.</span></p><p><span>So I don't know, maybe some of these Ethereum apps are actually different, and not just efforts to spark their own little bubbles. (After all, the Ethereum network can handle a whopping 30 transactions per second. Look out VISA!) But this stuff sounds *exactly* like the hype I've been hearing from Bitcoiners for a decade now, so you'll have to forgive me for being skeptical.</span></p><div role=\"button\" class=\"show-all-toggle\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"comment-actions\"><span><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Reply</a></span></div></td></tr></table><div class=\"more-replies-container\"><a href=\"https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comment/3732308\" class=\"more-replies\">3 replies</a></div><div class=\"comment-list-collapser\"><div class=\"comment-list-collapser-line\"></div></div></div><div class=\"comment\"><div id=\"comment-3733130\" class=\"comment-anchor\"></div><div id=\"comment-3733130-reply\" class=\"comment-anchor\"></div><table class=\"comment-content\"><tr><td class=\"comment-head\"><div class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"><div class=\"user-head \"><a href=\"https://substack.com/profile/1094901-frank-hecker\"><div class=\"profile-img-wrap\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_66,h_66,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0427613b-8fb0-4a09-b355-e60d89912c09_122x149.png\" alt /></div></a></div></div></td><td class=\"comment-rest\"><div class=\"comment-meta\"><span class=\"commenter-name\"><div class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Frank Hecker</a></div></span><span class=\"meta-details\"><a href=\"https://civilityandtruth.substack.com?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=comment_metadata\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"commenter-publication\">Writes <span> Civility and Truth (Archive Onl… </span></a><span class=\"comment-publication-name-separator\">·</span><a href=\"https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comment/3733130\" native>Nov 23, 2021</a></span></div><div class=\"comment-body\"><p><span>Like Will I have dabbled a little bit in crypto (I'm &quot;frankhecker.eth&quot;), and like Will I have thoughts: </span></p><p><span>1. Cryptocurrencies, along with the “metaverse” and half of the present-day TV line-up, can be thought of as one aspect of a general yearning for magic to (re)enter our ordinary lives: wave a wand and change the world or build a new one (like in Minecraft), conjure riches from base elements like earth and fire (use electricity and silicon to mint currencies), bind others to your will through spells that cannot be broken (smart contracts). And as with traditional magic there's a catch: like a wizard or demon you have a “true name” (your private key) which if discovered by others will enable them to seize all your powers and possessions.</span></p><p><span>2. The whole space is obviously soaked in libertarian ideas and ideals, not just distrust of fiat money and centralized governments, but the dream of a world in which rationality rules and from which “force and fraud” are banished, the former by moving to the digital realm, the latter by building that realm upon supposedly fool-proof algorithms designed to promote cooperation and deter defection.</span></p><p><span>3. Like other innovations before it (liberal democracy, limited liability corporations and the stock market, the Internet and the free software/open source movement), the promise of decentralization, individual empowerment, and shared prosperity is real but only partial, and elites will still rule, albeit refreshed with some new blood. As noted by others, “proof of work” schemes (Bitcoin, current Ethereum) are dominated by those able to deploy vast amounts of computing power. More efficient “proof of stake” schemes (proposed future Ethereum) and DAOs, like public companies, essentially run on the principle of “one dollar, one vote”, with influence disproportionately wielded by the rich and those who bought in early (often the same people). Power law dynamics will ensure that almost all participants in the NFT/crypto-driven “creator economy” will earn little or nothing, that only a few will earn middle class incomes (with chances much better for those in developing countries where the price of middle class status is lower, like the Filipinos who kicked Will's ass), and that the vast majority of economic rewards will be captured by the 0.1%. In the worst-case scenario an increasing fraction of global wealth held in deliberately deflationary cryptocurrencies will concentrate control of the world’s economy in the 0.0001% (10,000 people out of almost 8 billion hold one-third of all BTC), and a future William Jennings Bryan will decry the “cross of crypto”. (Recall that Bryan lost that election.)</span></p><p><span>4. In the end crypto will probably take its place along the other innovations I mentioned above: As with the early stock market, “pump and dump” schemes, other scams, and crypto-related criminality in general will be reduced (but not eliminated) over time (in large part through government regulations), with any dubiously-acquired fortunes becoming respectable as they pass down through inheritance and their origins are forgotten. As with the free software/open source movement, hierarchies will (re)establish themselves, albeit on a more inclusive basis, with most people participating in governance only on a cursory basis. And as with liberal democracy and limited liability corporations, new possibilities may arise for humanity to organize its affairs for the improvement of all, but realizing those possibilities will require more than unalloyed boosterism and a laissez-faire approach on the one hand, or a visceral refusal to engage with the topic on the other.</span></p><div role=\"button\"

Indeed, within my social/intellectual circles, the <em>dominant</em> view seems to be that Bitcoin amounts to <a href=\\\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/bitcoin-nfts-other-crypto-fads-are-destroying-our-planet-n1261139\\\">climate terrorism</a> in the service of <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/bitcoin-is-the-tulipmania-that-refuses-to-die\\\">tulip mania</a>, that <a href=\\\"https://every.to/napkin-math/nft-projects-are-just-mlms-for-tech-elites\\\">NFTs are a pyramid scheme</a>, and the main crypto use case is crime-enabling asset concealment and <a href=\\\"https://gizmodo.com/global-money-laundering-watchdog-says-uh-yeah-better-1847956545\\\">money laundering</a>.  The prevalence of this view spells trouble for the prospects of apposite regulatory forbearance and care. Which is a problem if it turns out that there\\u2019s a there there.     </p><p>Now, I\\u2019m sensitive and sympathetic to the \\u201C<a href=\\\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgzed/what-the-hell-is-right-clicker-mentality\\\">right-clicker</a>\\u201D view because, well, I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s more than a little money laundering, uninternalized climate externalities, greater-fool pyramid scheming, and frothy speculation in cryptoland. It\\u2019s not great, and it\\u2019s totally worth taking seriously. Until recently, I was skeptical of the whole deal, too. </p><p>However, a few of my best and smartest friends are <em>deeply</em> into crypto stuff and know more about it than I do. One of my personal epistemic precepts is that if I disagree with somebody who is (a) at least smart as I am, (b) has generally sound judgment <em>and </em>(c) is better informed on a subject, then I ought to concede that I\\u2019m probably wrong and revise my opinion in their direction. The trouble is, I also know plenty of people who satisfy all these conditions but think crypto is unmitigated bullshit. That is to say, we\\u2019ve got a rare instance of not-obviously-political intra-smart polarization on our hands! Or, as I tweeted a while back:</p><div class=\\\"tweet\\\" data-attrs=\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1458687247444635648&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Either an amazing number of smart people are getting snookered or an amazing number of smart people are uninformed and unimaginative &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;willwilkinson&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Will Wilkinson \\uD83C\\uDF10&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Nov 11 06:45:15 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I've been reading and chatting with people in hopes of understanding why so many game companies are acting so excited about blockchain and every single answer seems to be \\\\&quot;This is the future of the industry but we don't know why\\\\&quot; (this one is from an earnings call) https://t.co/9EFMP5XGS3&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;jasonschreier&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jason Schreier&quot;},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:4,&quot;like_count&quot;:51,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}\\\"><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1458687247444635648\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><div class=\\\"tweet-header\\\"><img class=\\\"tweet-user-avatar\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/willwilkinson.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Twitter avatar for @willwilkinson\\\"><span class=\\\"tweet-author-name\\\">Will Wilkinson \\uD83C\\uDF10 </span><span class=\\\"tweet-author\\\">@willwilkinson</span></div>Either an amazing number of smart people are getting snookered or an amazing number of smart people are uninformed and unimaginative <div class=\\\"quoted-tweet\\\"><p><span class=\\\"quote-tweet-name\\\">Jason Schreier </span><span class=\\\"quote-tweet-username\\\">@jasonschreier</span></p>I've been reading and chatting with people in hopes of understanding why so many game companies are acting so excited about blockchain and every single answer seems to be \\\"This is the future of the industry but we don't know why\\\" (this one is from an earnings call) https://t.co/9EFMP5XGS3</div></a><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/willwilkinson/status/1458687247444635648\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><div class=\\\"tweet-footer\\\"><p class=\\\"tweet-date\\\">November 11th 2021</p><span class=\\\"retweets\\\"><span class=\\\"rt-count\\\">4</span> Retweets</span><span class=\\\"likes\\\"><span class=\\\"like-count\\\">51</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>What\\u2019s a virtuous Bayesian to do? I figure you either adopt the Pyrrhonian skeptical stance, suspend judgment, set your <em>p</em> at .5 and go Swiss\\u2026 <em>or </em>you<em> </em>get more information. <em> </em>For my part, I want to know whether I\\u2019m a doofus for putting a modest amount of money into Ether. At one level, I'd like to just shrug and say \\u201Cguess we\\u2019ll find out\\u201D sooner or later. At another level, I\\u2019d really like to know whether I ought to buy, sell or hold.  Rational agnosticism isn\\u2019t much help in balancing your portfolio. So I went with <em>get</em> <em>more information</em> and started bingeing crypto podcasts. </p><p>Right away I noticed something essential about polarized attitudes about crypto: it\\u2019s driven to a large extent by vexed will-to-obliviousness on one side and self-dealing, book-talking, investment-pumping, hand-waving performative optimism on the other. </p><p>Once you get up to speed on the basics (which honestly takes a fair amount of work) it\\u2019s plain that a lot of crypto skepticism is little more than annoyance over the constant encroachment of baffling, unwanted crypto news into the ambit of one\\u2019s awareness.

Now, I don\\u2019t know if Chabon\\u2019s crypto-skeptical or -hostile or anything like that. But the idea that crypto topics <em>repel attention</em>, but seem to keep demanding it from us nevertheless, gets at something essential about the mood of widespread exasperation and antagonism around crypto. A lot of us just don\\u2019t understand it, don\\u2019t want to understand it, and wish people would just shut up about it. That\\u2019s sort of how I felt before diving in head-first \\u2014 though, like Chabon, I was a bit ashamed about not wanting to understand it. </p><p>Anyway, if that\\u2019s your attitude, and you encounter what looks to you to like relatively informed anti-crypto commentary, you\\u2019ll be tempted to latch on to it uncritically to justify resistance to learning anything about it. The urge to rationalize tuning out is surely amplified by the fact that laser-eyed online crypto bros are insufferable dicks. But it\\u2019s not simply that they\\u2019re insufferable. It\\u2019s also that a bunch of them are getting ridiculously rich, which is insufferably insufferable, and raises the anxious specter of FOMO to boot. There\\u2019s real comfort in the idea that crypto\\u2019s nothing but a faddish planet-wrecking house-of-cards scam; it\\u2019s a buffer against nagging FOMO, regret, or a sense of obligation to learn something \\u2014 a fate which might beset us were we to suspect that this stuff <em>could be</em> legit, genuinely innovative, and part of a transformative technological, financial, and cultural paradigm-shift.</p><p>On the pro-crypto side, however, we\\u2019ve got totally deranged confidence that the future will be built on the blockchain and run on cryptocurrency. The first thing you learn when you start listening to crypto podcasts is that people don\\u2019t do them because they\\u2019re duly skeptical and rigorously neutral about Bitcoin. They do them because they\\u2019ve bought in and are super-excited about the torrid growth of their crypto investments. They\\u2019re all, in one way or another, talking their book. </p><p>So where does this leave an honest dealer keen to cash in on the future but not so keen on getting duped? Well, you obviously can\\u2019t trust the negative Nancies dug into derisive ignorance as defense against FOMO. I mean, they <em>proudly</em> admit that they don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re talking about. But you also can\\u2019t trust the exhausting monorail-salesman <a href=\\\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wagmi\\\">WAGMI</a> hype.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a class=\\\"image-link image2\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif\\\"><img src=\\\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif\\\" width=\\\"480\\\" height=\\\"362\\\" data-attrs=\\\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1901656,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\\\" class=\\\"sizing-normal\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></figure></div><p>My general rule about subject in which I haven\\u2019t developed significant independent knowledge is simply to believe whatever the consensus of credible experts happens to be. That\\u2019s easier said than done in this case, because it\\u2019s tough to say what expertise or credibility looks like when there\\u2019s a hot dispute about the legitimacy of the entire domain. When the conditions for non-question-begging expert identification break down, there\\u2019s not a lot you can do other than to \\u201Cdo my own research,\\u201D fully aware of the pitfalls, and try to come to some reasonable conclusions on your own steam. It\\u2019s always disorienting to push into unfamiliar territory without a map, but that\\u2019s okay. Embracing the vertigo of not-knowing is how we learn. </p><p>What I try to do in this sort of situation is steer into the confusion, horse around<em>, </em>experiment,<em> </em>and see if a gestalt of comprehension begins to coalesce.

You should browse through it. I promise you\\u2019ll learn something.   </p><p>Anyway, what I did to get started was learn to use <a href=\\\"https://metamask.io/\\\">Metamask</a> and buy some NFTs. Not some silly jpg cartoon avatar, mind you, but stuff that seemed to me more useful and functional. I bought an Ethereum Name Service domain, willwilkinson.eth. It makes it super-easy for people to send me money without knowing my public address. (You should try it!) It also <a href=\\\"https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=willwilkinson.eth\\\">makes it easy</a> for anybody to see <a href=\\\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0257141c5ed5b522c2ca19f0f7fe5eeb65768e6\\\">every transaction involving the connected wallet</a>. So, for example, you can see that I bought some shitty Axies in <a href=\\\"https://axieinfinity.com/\\\">Axie Infinity </a>, which I used to get my ass kicked repeatedly by <a href=\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/people-in-philippines-earn-cryptocurrency-playing-nft-video-game-axie-infinity.html\\\">semi-pro Filipinos</a>. You know what? It doesn\\u2019t feel like bullshit. </p><p>This is when it really started to click to me. I\\u2019m not actually interested in fighting and breeding cute virtual creatures. But experiencing an in-game economy built to integrate with the real economy was eye-opening. Felix plays Roblox and loves to customize his avatar, collect pets, and special items his dude can carry around. He\\u2019d love to be able to literally own these things, buy and sell them, and cash out at the click of a button. But that kind of game application is just the most obvious type of thing blockchains makes easier. </p><p>Presently, the dominant blockchain/Web 3.0 application is decentralized finance, but I think it\\u2019s easier to see the value of where things are heading, and to allay worries about hype cycles, pyramid schemes and speculative bubbles, if we look past the purely financial stuff. Once you start to dig into some of the applications that venture capitalists have been plowing truckloads of old-fashioned American dollars into, you run into various kinds of decentralized networks built out and maintained by tokenized incentives. When you read about them, the value proposition makes a lot of sense. </p><p>So, for example, you have things like <a href=\\\"https://filecoin.io/\\\">Filecoin</a>, which describes itself as \\u201Can open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and incentive layer.\\u201D What does that mean? It means you can set up a data center in your garage and get paid in the network currency for reliably storing and serving data. Or consider <a href=\\\"https://rendertoken.com/\\\">Render</a>, which does \\u201Cdistributed GPU rending on the blockchain.\\u201D That is to say, it incentivizes people to rent out GPU processing for graphics rendering. Or take <a href=\\\"https://www.helium.com/mine\\\">Helium</a>, which seeks to create a wireless network  for IoT/Internet of Things sensors and smart devices by incentivizing people to install certain types of radio transmitters and keeping them running. </p><p>Obviously, things like Amazon Web Services and wireless networks already exist. But blockchain incentives, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts can do it all in a fundamentally different, more decentralized way. Once I saw that this decentralization has a variety of technical, economic, and political advantages, it became started to become clear to me that there\\u2019s definitely a there there. More than that, I started to see that it\\u2019s probably pretty <em>good </em>there<em>\\u2014 </em>that we should <em>want to go to there</em>, as TV\\u2019s Liz Lemon liked to say. </p><p>In particular, I find the diffuse capitalization, ownership, and control of these kinds of networks extremely appealing. It\\u2019s this \\u2014 not stupid ape avatars or hype about Bitcoin as \\u201Cdigital gold\\u201D \\u2014 that gets me charged up about crypto/blockchain stuff. It\\u2019s also why think we need to be careful about regulation that could strangle the baby in the crib. It\\u2019s not bullshit. It looks to me like it <em>could</em> be a way back to the beautifully decentralized freedom of Web 1.0. </p><p>Think about who owns the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks. Nobody does. Nobody owns them. These networks are made up of many thousands of machines whose computational power has been allocated to the network because the network\\u2019s constitutive code pays the people who own the machines to keep them connected and churning away \\u2014 and on super-reliable, coded-in terms that can\\u2019t be whimsically revised. </p><p>Replicating everything AWS or Azure or Google Cloud can do on a blockchain isn\\u2019t redundant because the decentralized collective \\u201Cownership\\u201D and governance of blockchain networks supports security, privacy, stability, and scalability features that Web 2.0 applications running on centralized corporate clouds can\\u2019t replicate <em>because </em>they are centralized and control is concentrated. </p><p>This kind of decentralization has pretty radical distributive implications. When there is nobody at the top, nobody at the top can hoard the value generated by the network. The economic surplus generated by this kind of network is <em>necessarily </em>distributed to the community of miners, stakers, and users because that\\u2019s what brings them into existence, keeps them going and lends them value. The diffusion of economic surplus is part of the basic architecture of the system. Market structure, distributive principles, and defenses against network domination are all baked into the code. </p><p>In my opinion, a technological/economic/institutional architecture that can coordinate economic activity in a way that makes the firm superfluous, deconcentrates ownership and control over vital networks, and broadly distributes economic surplus to network participants according to transparent, fair and relatively fixed rules, <em>is </em>the killer app. This can hard to see because the principal value of the underlying technical innovation is economic, organizational, and, ultimately, political. The consumer-facing technology that can be built on top of is genuinely exciting, but secondary.

But this is not a very convincing piece because you don't actually address the damning technical problems that well-informed critics of blockchain technology point to, perhaps because- as you candidly admit- this is a subject that's well outside your own area of expertise.\\n\\nBut the technical details are kind of the point. If you start from the assumption that \\\"blockchain incentives, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts can do it all in a fundamentally different, more decentralized way\\\" then yes, obviously that's a big deal. But the question is whether that's true! And there's very good reason to think it isn't.\\n\\nIf we take the example of Bitcoin specifically, people have been making all of the exact same promises about radical decentralization and mass adoption for more than a decade now, but- at least in the narrow case of Bitcoin- it's all complete horseshit.\\n\\nEconomies of scale meant that mining became extremely centralized early on, and a handful of men (I believe they're all men) now control the overwhelming majority of all mining power, meaning that Bitcoin is not actually \\\"trustless\\\" in any real sense. So, uh, why not just have those same guys run a database that keeps track of who owns which Bitcoins and save us all ~180TWh of electricity every year?\\n\\nMeanwhile mass adoption is a practical impossibility because the whole system has a *hard theoretical limit* of ten transactions per second (it's about half that in actual practice). For comparison, the Visa network does about 1,700 transactions per second and could hypothetically do many more. Bitcoin boosters are generally either not aware of this inconvenient fact, or will gesture wildly in the direction of some piece of vaporware (like the much-hyped and utterly harebrained Lightning Network) that's always just a few years away. And this is not some hypothetical future problem! The network *already* ground to halt in 2017, with hundreds of thousands of unconfirmed transactions getting stuck in limbo, and has largely ceased to function as an actual payment system since then.\\n\\nAnd the truly wild thing is that none of this mattered for the price of Bitcoin! The price just kept going up even as it became clear that the network is fundamentally broken! It was almost as though the technology was never really the point, anymore than the specific qualities of the tulips or the Beanie Babies were the point in past speculative manias.\\n\\nSo I don't know, maybe some of these Ethereum apps are actually different, and not just efforts to spark their own little bubbles. (After all, the Ethereum network can handle a whopping 30 transactions per second. Look out VISA!) But this stuff sounds *exactly* like the hype I've been hearing from Bitcoiners for a decade now, so you'll have to forgive me for being skeptical.\",\"date\":\"2021-11-23T04:48:42.971Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"type\":\"comment\",\"reply_from_post_id\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"edited_at\":null,\"updated_at\":\"2021-11-23T04:48:42.971Z\",\"status_updated_at\":null,\"name\":\"Nicholas Baker\",\"photo_url\":\"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b650e54-d1c9-4c70-a012-fc8ac21a3bc1_400x400.jpeg\",\"reactions\":{\"\\u2764\":36},\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[],\"bans\":[],\"suppressed\":false,\"user_banned\":false,\"user_banned_for_comment\":false,\"metadata\":{\"is_author\":false,\"eligibleForGift\":false},\"score\":1.5416666666666667,\"reported_by_user\":false,\"childrenSummary\":\"3 replies\"},{\"id\":3733130,\"user_id\":1094901,\"publication_id\":3846,\"post_id\":43902349,\"ancestor_path\":\"\",\"body\":\"Like Will I have dabbled a little bit in crypto (I'm \\\"frankhecker.eth\\\"), and like Will I have thoughts: \\n\\n1. Cryptocurrencies, along with the \\u201Cmetaverse\\u201D and half of the present-day TV line-up, can be thought of as one aspect of a general yearning for magic to (re)enter our ordinary lives: wave a wand and change the world or build a new one (like in Minecraft), conjure riches from base elements like earth and fire (use electricity and silicon to mint currencies), bind others to your will through spells that cannot be broken (smart contracts). And as with traditional magic there's a catch: like a wizard or demon you have a \\u201Ctrue name\\u201D (your private key) which if discovered by others will enable them to seize all your powers and possessions.\\n\\n2. The whole space is obviously soaked in libertarian ideas and ideals, not just distrust of fiat money and centralized governments, but the dream of a world in which rationality rules and from which \\u201Cforce and fraud\\u201D are banished, the former by moving to the digital realm, the latter by building that realm upon supposedly fool-proof algorithms designed to promote cooperation and deter defection.\\n\\n3. Like other innovations before it (liberal democracy, limited liability corporations and the stock market, the Internet and the free software/open source movement), the promise of decentralization, individual empowerment, and shared prosperity is real but only partial, and elites will still rule, albeit refreshed with some new blood. As noted by others, \\u201Cproof of work\\u201D schemes (Bitcoin, current Ethereum) are dominated by those able to deploy vast amounts of computing power. More efficient \\u201Cproof of stake\\u201D schemes (proposed future Ethereum) and DAOs, like public companies, essentially run on the principle of \\u201Cone dollar, one vote\\u201D, with influence disproportionately wielded by the rich and those who bought in early (often the same people). Power law dynamics will ensure that almost all participants in the NFT/crypto-driven \\u201Ccreator economy\\u201D will earn little or nothing, that only a few will earn middle class incomes (with chances much better for those in developing countries where the price of middle class status is lower, like the Filipinos who kicked Will's ass), and that the vast majority of economic rewards will be captured by the 0.1%. In the worst-case scenario an increasing fraction of global wealth held in deliberately deflationary cryptocurrencies will concentrate control of the world\\u2019s economy in the 0.0001% (10,000 people out of almost 8 billion hold one-third of all BTC), and a future William Jennings Bryan will decry the \\u201Ccross of crypto\\u201D. (Recall that Bryan lost that election.)\\n\\n4. In the end crypto will probably take its place along the other innovations I mentioned above: As with the early stock market, \\u201Cpump and dump\\u201D schemes, other scams, and crypto-related criminality in general will be reduced (but not eliminated) over time (in large part through government regulations), with any dubiously-acquired fortunes becoming respectable as they pass down through inheritance and their origins are forgotten. As with the free software/open source movement, hierarchies will (re)establish themselves, albeit on a more inclusive basis, with most people participating in governance only on a cursory basis. And as with liberal democracy and limited liability corporations, new possibilities may arise for humanity to organize its affairs for the improvement of all, but realizing those possibilities will require more than unalloyed boosterism and a laissez-faire approach on the one hand, or a visceral refusal to engage with the topic on the other.\",\"date\":\"2021-11-23T08:20:40.203Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"type\":\"comment\",\"reply_from_post_id\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"edited_at\":null,\"updated_at\":\"2021-11-23T08:20:40.203Z\",\"status_updated_at\":null,\"name\":\"Frank Hecker\",\"photo_url\":\"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0427613b-8fb0-4a09-b355-e60d89912c09_122x149.png\",\"reactions\":{\"\\u2764\":13},\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[],\"bans\":[],\"suppressed\":false,\"user_banned\":false,\"user_banned_for_comment\":false,\"metadata\":{\"is_author\":false,\"eligibleForGift\":false,\"author_on_other_pub\":{\"name\":\"Civility and Truth (Archive Only)\",\"base_url\":\"https://civilityandtruth.substack.com\"}},\"score\":0.5833333333333334,\"reported_by_user\":false}],\"post_reaction_token\":null,\"canonicalUrl\":\"https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit\",\"inlineComments\":false,\"readerIsSearchCrawler\":false,\"features\":{}}</script>\n        <script>window._analyticsConfig = {\"user\":null,\"properties\":{\"subdomain\":\"modelcitizen\",\"publication_id\":3846,\"has_plans\":false,\"pub_community_enabled\":true,\"parent_publication_id\":null,\"parent_publication_subdomain\":null,\"is_parent_publication\":false,\"section_name\":null,\"section_slug\":null,\"section_id\":null,\"section_is_podcast\":null,\"is_subscribed\":false,\"is_free_subscribed\":false,\"is_author\":false,\"is_contributor\":false,\"is_admin\":false}}</script>\n        <script src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/min/main.bundle.js?v=129d91-17f6fe1cb58\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n        <!-- Fallback tracking pixels -->\n        \n        <noscript><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"display:none\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=261279515539365&ev=PageView&noscript=1\"/></noscript>\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        <noscript>\n    <style>\n        #nojs-banner {\n            position: fixed;\n            bottom: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            padding: 16px 16px 16px 32px;\n            width: 100%;\n            box-sizing: border-box;\n            background: red;\n            color: white;\n            font-family: -apple-system, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, \"Apple Color Emoji\", \"Segoe UI Emoji\", \"Segoe UI Symbol\";\n            font-size: 13px;\n            line-height: 13px;\n        }\n        #nojs-banner a {\n            color: inherit;\n            text-decoration: underline;\n        }\n    </style>\n\n    <div id=\"nojs-banner\">\n        This site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Why not both? </figcaption></figure></div><p>As you may have gathered from my previous post, I’ve become interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation. I’ve honestly been a little hesitant to write about this stuff because opinions on the subject are oddly polarized. I know I’ve got crypto-skeptical readers, followers and friends who would be exasperated if I suddenly started spouting off about it all the time. Last week, Venkatesh Rao noted the hostile reaction after tweeting about minting his first NFT (non-fungible token):</p><p>If you click through to the results of Rao’s Twitter poll, you’ll see that it shows far more hostility than participation in “<a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/\" rel=\"\">Web3</a>” blockchain stuff. This obviously isn’t in any sense scientific, but it accords with my vague impression, which is why I was braced for some “polite but hostile” feedback, which was duly received. In the comments, subscriber Trevor Austin, a software engineer who surely knows more about this than I do, writes:</p><blockquote><p>I did some dabbling in Solidity two years ago when my company explored a crypto moonshot slash ICO cash grab, and I came away thinking there's mostly no there there… If anything I've become even more bearish since about smart contracts and web3 watching the NFT hype cycle blossom. Are there *any* problems solved by blockchains that aren't better handled by a nonprofit org with a good charter and a mysql database?</p></blockquote><p>I’ve heard endless versions of the “What problem does this solve!?” plaint ever since delving into this world of mystery and wonder. Similarly, Tom Lee, a long-time mutual follow and super-tech savvy IRL friendly acquaintance, tweeted: </p><p>Tom’s point seems to me to assume that something important is gained but nothing of offsetting importance is lost if burdensome-to-impossible reporting requirements hamper the use and development of blockchain tech and herd people back into the mediated and surveilled <em>status quo</em> <em>ante</em>. This is a <em>very </em>common sentiment. Indeed, within my social/intellectual circles, the <em>dominant</em> view seems to be that Bitcoin amounts to <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/bitcoin-nfts-other-crypto-fads-are-destroying-our-planet-n1261139\" rel=\"\">climate terrorism</a> in the service of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/bitcoin-is-the-tulipmania-that-refuses-to-die\" rel=\"\">tulip mania</a>, that <a href=\"https://every.to/napkin-math/nft-projects-are-just-mlms-for-tech-elites\" rel=\"\">NFTs are a pyramid scheme</a>, and the main crypto use case is crime-enabling asset concealment and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/global-money-laundering-watchdog-says-uh-yeah-better-1847956545\" rel=\"\">money laundering</a>.  The prevalence of this view spells trouble for the prospects of apposite regulatory forbearance and care. Which is a problem if it turns out that there’s a there there.     </p><p>Now, I’m sensitive and sympathetic to the “<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgzed/what-the-hell-is-right-clicker-mentality\" rel=\"\">right-clicker</a>” view because, well, I’m sure there’s more than a little money laundering, uninternalized climate externalities, greater-fool pyramid scheming, and frothy speculation in cryptoland. It’s not great, and it’s totally worth taking seriously. Until recently, I was skeptical of the whole deal, too. </p><p>However, a few of my best and smartest friends are <em>deeply</em> into crypto stuff and know more about it than I do. One of my personal epistemic precepts is that if I disagree with somebody who is (a) at least smart as I am, (b) has generally sound judgment <em>and </em>(c) is better informed on a subject, then I ought to concede that I’m probably wrong and revise my opinion in their direction. The trouble is, I also know plenty of people who satisfy all these conditions but think crypto is unmitigated bullshit. That is to say, we’ve got a rare instance of not-obviously-political intra-smart polarization on our hands! Or, as I tweeted a while back:</p><p>What’s a virtuous Bayesian to do? I figure you either adopt the Pyrrhonian skeptical stance, suspend judgment, set your <em>p</em> at .5 and go Swiss… <em>or </em>you<em> </em>get more information. <em> </em>For my part, I want to know whether I’m a doofus for putting a modest amount of money into Ether. At one level, I'd like to just shrug and say “guess we’ll find out” sooner or later. At another level, I’d really like to know whether I ought to buy, sell or hold.  Rational agnosticism isn’t much help in balancing your portfolio. So I went with <em>get</em> <em>more information</em> and started bingeing crypto podcasts. </p><p>Right away I noticed something essential about polarized attitudes about crypto: it’s driven to a large extent by vexed will-to-obliviousness on one side and self-dealing, book-talking, investment-pumping, hand-waving performative optimism on the other. </p><p>Once you get up to speed on the basics (which honestly takes a fair amount of work) it’s plain that a lot of crypto skepticism is little more than annoyance over the constant encroachment of baffling, unwanted crypto news into the ambit of one’s awareness. Michael Chabon’s reply (happens all the time, nbd) to a recent tweet of mine about mainstream under-coverage of the weirdness of the NFT craze captures something central to crypto discourse:</p><p>I mean, it’s hard to beat “NFTs seem to repel attention, as if coated in oil of tedium.” No wonder the man’s got a Pulitzer! Now, I don’t know if Chabon’s crypto-skeptical or -hostile or anything like that. But the idea that crypto topics <em>repel attention</em>, but seem to keep demanding it from us nevertheless, gets at something essential about the mood of widespread exasperation and antagonism around crypto. A lot of us just don’t understand it, don’t want to understand it, and wish people would just shut up about it. That’s sort of how I felt before diving in head-first — though, like Chabon, I was a bit ashamed about not wanting to understand it. </p><p>Anyway, if that’s your attitude, and you encounter what looks to you to like relatively informed anti-crypto commentary, you’ll be tempted to latch on to it uncritically to justify resistance to learning anything about it. The urge to rationalize tuning out is surely amplified by the fact that laser-eyed online crypto bros are insufferable dicks. But it’s not simply that they’re insufferable. It’s also that a bunch of them are getting ridiculously rich, which is insufferably insufferable, and raises the anxious specter of FOMO to boot. There’s real comfort in the idea that crypto’s nothing but a faddish planet-wrecking house-of-cards scam; it’s a buffer against nagging FOMO, regret, or a sense of obligation to learn something — a fate which might beset us were we to suspect that this stuff <em>could be</em> legit, genuinely innovative, and part of a transformative technological, financial, and cultural paradigm-shift.</p><p>On the pro-crypto side, however, we’ve got totally deranged confidence that the future will be built on the blockchain and run on cryptocurrency. The first thing you learn when you start listening to crypto podcasts is that people don’t do them because they’re duly skeptical and rigorously neutral about Bitcoin. They do them because they’ve bought in and are super-excited about the torrid growth of their crypto investments. They’re all, in one way or another, talking their book. </p><p>So where does this leave an honest dealer keen to cash in on the future but not so keen on getting duped? Well, you obviously can’t trust the negative Nancies dug into derisive ignorance as defense against FOMO. I mean, they <em>proudly</em> admit that they don’t know what they’re talking about. But you also can’t trust the exhausting monorail-salesman <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wagmi\" rel=\"\">WAGMI</a> hype.</p><div><figure><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif\" width=\"480\" height=\"362\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02ccb08c-a0b8-4730-b756-6bd5c802e5f6_480x362.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1901656,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"></a></figure></div><p>My general rule about subject in which I haven’t developed significant independent knowledge is simply to believe whatever the consensus of credible experts happens to be. That’s easier said than done in this case, because it’s tough to say what expertise or credibility looks like when there’s a hot dispute about the legitimacy of the entire domain. When the conditions for non-question-begging expert identification break down, there’s not a lot you can do other than to “do my own research,” fully aware of the pitfalls, and try to come to some reasonable conclusions on your own steam.

You should browse through it. I promise you’ll learn something.   </p><p>Anyway, what I did to get started was learn to use <a href=\"https://metamask.io/\" rel=\"\">Metamask</a> and buy some NFTs. Not some silly jpg cartoon avatar, mind you, but stuff that seemed to me more useful and functional. I bought an Ethereum Name Service domain, willwilkinson.eth.

You know what? It doesn’t feel like bullshit. </p><p>This is when it really started to click to me. I’m not actually interested in fighting and breeding cute virtual creatures. But experiencing an in-game economy built to integrate with the real economy was eye-opening. Felix plays Roblox and loves to customize his avatar, collect pets, and special items his dude can carry around. He’d love to be able to literally own these things, buy and sell them, and cash out at the click of a button. But that kind of game application is just the most obvious type of thing blockchains makes easier. </p><p>Presently, the dominant blockchain/Web 3.0 application is decentralized finance, but I think it’s easier to see the value of where things are heading, and to allay worries about hype cycles, pyramid schemes and speculative bubbles, if we look past the purely financial stuff. Once you start to dig into some of the applications that venture capitalists have been plowing truckloads of old-fashioned American dollars into, you run into various kinds of decentralized networks built out and maintained by tokenized incentives. When you read about them, the value proposition makes a lot of sense. </p><p>So, for example, you have things like <a href=\"https://filecoin.io/\" rel=\"\">Filecoin</a>, which describes itself as “an open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and incentive layer.” What does that mean? It means you can set up a data center in your garage and get paid in the network currency for reliably storing and serving data. Or consider <a href=\"https://rendertoken.com/\" rel=\"\">Render</a>, which does “distributed GPU rending on the blockchain.” That is to say, it incentivizes people to rent out GPU processing for graphics rendering. Or take <a href=\"https://www.helium.com/mine\" rel=\"\">Helium</a>, which seeks to create a wireless network  for IoT/Internet of Things sensors and smart devices by incentivizing people to install certain types of radio transmitters and keeping them running. </p><p>Obviously, things like Amazon Web Services and wireless networks already exist. But blockchain incentives, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts can do it all in a fundamentally different, more decentralized way. Once I saw that this decentralization has a variety of technical, economic, and political advantages, it became started to become clear to me that there’s definitely a there there. More than that, I started to see that it’s probably pretty <em>good </em>there<em>— </em>that we should <em>want to go to there</em>, as TV’s Liz Lemon liked to say. </p><p>In particular, I find the diffuse capitalization, ownership, and control of these kinds of networks extremely appealing. It’s this — not stupid ape avatars or hype about Bitcoin as “digital gold” — that gets me charged up about crypto/blockchain stuff. It’s also why think we need to be careful about regulation that could strangle the baby in the crib. It’s not bullshit. It looks to me like it <em>could</em> be a way back to the beautifully decentralized freedom of Web 1.0. </p><p>Think about who owns the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks. Nobody does. Nobody owns them. These networks are made up of many thousands of machines whose computational power has been allocated to the network because the network’s constitutive code pays the people who own the machines to keep them connected and churning away — and on super-reliable, coded-in terms that can’t be whimsically revised. </p><p>Replicating everything AWS or Azure or Google Cloud can do on a blockchain isn’t redundant because the decentralized collective “ownership” and governance of blockchain networks supports security, privacy, stability, and scalability features that Web 2.0 applications running on centralized corporate clouds can’t replicate <em>because </em>they are centralized and control is concentrated. </p><p>This kind of decentralization has pretty radical distributive implications. When there is nobody at the top, nobody at the top can hoard the value generated by the network. The economic surplus generated by this kind of network is <em>necessarily </em>distributed to the community of miners, stakers, and users because that’s what brings them into existence, keeps them going and lends them value. The diffusion of economic surplus is part of the basic architecture of the system. Market structure, distributive principles, and defenses against network domination are all baked into the code. </p><p>In my opinion, a technological/economic/institutional architecture that can coordinate economic activity in a way that makes the firm superfluous, deconcentrates ownership and control over vital networks, and broadly distributes economic surplus to network participants according to transparent, fair and relatively fixed rules, <em>is </em>the killer app. This can hard to see because the principal value of the underlying technical innovation is economic, organizational, and, ultimately, political. The consumer-facing technology that can be built on top of is genuinely exciting, but secondary. Naturally enough, this was all <em>impossible </em>for me to see before I started to seriously dabble, which made me genuinely curious about how it all works and finally drove me to read a number of extremely dry but profoundly informative white papers. </p><p>For now, I’m sold. I think there’s a there there. I honestly think blockchain <em>can</em> change the world — and for the better. Which, I’m sorry to say, makes it pretty hard to shut up about it. My sincerest apologies to all for whom the entire subject is “coated in oil of tedium,” especially my beloved and longsuffering wife.  </p><p data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\"><a href=\"https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bullshit/comments\" rel=\"\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p></div></article></div></div>","textContent":"Planet-wrecking money laundry or the next phase of human evolution? Why not both? As you may have gathered from my previous post, I’ve become interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation. I’ve honestly been a little hesitant to write about this stuff because opinions on the subject are oddly polarized. I know I’ve got crypto-skeptical readers, followers and friends who would be exasperated if I suddenly started spouting off about it all the time. Last week, Venkatesh Rao noted the hostile reaction after tweeting about minting his first NFT (non-fungible token):If you click through to the results of Rao’s Twitter poll, you’ll see that it shows far more hostility than participation in “Web3” blockchain stuff. This obviously isn’t in any sense scientific, but it accords with my vague impression, which is why I was braced for some “polite but hostile” feedback, which was duly received. In the comments, subscriber Trevor Austin, a software engineer who surely knows more about this than I do, writes:I did some dabbling in Solidity two years ago when my company explored a crypto moonshot slash ICO cash grab, and I came away thinking there's mostly no there there… If anything I've become even more bearish since about smart contracts and web3 watching the NFT hype cycle blossom. Are there *any* problems solved by blockchains that aren't better handled by a nonprofit org with a good charter and a mysql database?I’ve heard endless versions of the “What problem does this solve!?” plaint ever since delving into this world of mystery and wonder. Similarly, Tom Lee, a long-time mutual follow and super-tech savvy IRL friendly acquaintance, tweeted: Tom’s point seems to me to assume that something important is gained but nothing of offsetting importance is lost if burdensome-to-impossible reporting requirements hamper the use and development of blockchain tech and herd people back into the mediated and surveilled status quo ante. This is a very common sentiment. Indeed, within my social/intellectual circles, the dominant view seems to be that Bitcoin amounts to climate terrorism in the service of tulip mania, that NFTs are a pyramid scheme, and the main crypto use case is crime-enabling asset concealment and money laundering.  The prevalence of this view spells trouble for the prospects of apposite regulatory forbearance and care. Which is a problem if it turns out that there’s a there there.     Now, I’m sensitive and sympathetic to the “right-clicker” view because, well, I’m sure there’s more than a little money laundering, uninternalized climate externalities, greater-fool pyramid scheming, and frothy speculation in cryptoland. It’s not great, and it’s totally worth taking seriously. Until recently, I was skeptical of the whole deal, too. However, a few of my best and smartest friends are deeply into crypto stuff and know more about it than I do. One of my personal epistemic precepts is that if I disagree with somebody who is (a) at least smart as I am, (b) has generally sound judgment and (c) is better informed on a subject, then I ought to concede that I’m probably wrong and revise my opinion in their direction. The trouble is, I also know plenty of people who satisfy all these conditions but think crypto is unmitigated bullshit. That is to say, we’ve got a rare instance of not-obviously-political intra-smart polarization on our hands! Or, as I tweeted a while back:What’s a virtuous Bayesian to do? I figure you either adopt the Pyrrhonian skeptical stance, suspend judgment, set your p at .5 and go Swiss… or you get more information.  For my part, I want to know whether I’m a doofus for putting a modest amount of money into Ether. At one level, I'd like to just shrug and say “guess we’ll find out” sooner or later. At another level, I’d really like to know whether I ought to buy, sell or hold.  Rational agnosticism isn’t much help in balancing your portfolio. So I went with get more information and started bingeing crypto podcasts. Right away I noticed something essential about polarized attitudes about crypto: it’s driven to a large extent by vexed will-to-obliviousness on one side and self-dealing, book-talking, investment-pumping, hand-waving performative optimism on the other. Once you get up to speed on the basics (which honestly takes a fair amount of work) it’s plain that a lot of crypto skepticism is little more than annoyance over the constant encroachment of baffling, unwanted crypto news into the ambit of one’s awareness. Michael Chabon’s reply (happens all the time, nbd) to a recent tweet of mine about mainstream under-coverage of the weirdness of the NFT craze captures something central to crypto discourse:I mean, it’s hard to beat “NFTs seem to repel attention, as if coated in oil of tedium.” No wonder the man’s got a Pulitzer! Now, I don’t know if Chabon’s crypto-skeptical or -hostile or anything like that. But the idea that crypto topics repel attention, but seem to keep demanding it from us nevertheless, gets at something essential about the mood of widespread exasperation and antagonism around crypto. A lot of us just don’t understand it, don’t want to understand it, and wish people would just shut up about it. That’s sort of how I felt before diving in head-first — though, like Chabon, I was a bit ashamed about not wanting to understand it. Anyway, if that’s your attitude, and you encounter what looks to you to like relatively informed anti-crypto commentary, you’ll be tempted to latch on to it uncritically to justify resistance to learning anything about it. The urge to rationalize tuning out is surely amplified by the fact that laser-eyed online crypto bros are insufferable dicks. But it’s not simply that they’re insufferable. It’s also that a bunch of them are getting ridiculously rich, which is insufferably insufferable, and raises the anxious specter of FOMO to boot. There’s real comfort in the idea that crypto’s nothing but a faddish planet-wrecking house-of-cards scam; it’s a buffer against nagging FOMO, regret, or a sense of obligation to learn something — a fate which might beset us were we to suspect that this stuff could be legit, genuinely innovative, and part of a transformative technological, financial, and cultural paradigm-shift.On the pro-crypto side, however, we’ve got totally deranged confidence that the future will be built on the blockchain and run on cryptocurrency. The first thing you learn when you start listening to crypto podcasts is that people don’t do them because they’re duly skeptical and rigorously neutral about Bitcoin. They do them because they’ve bought in and are super-excited about the torrid growth of their crypto investments. They’re all, in one way or another, talking their book. So where does this leave an honest dealer keen to cash in on the future but not so keen on getting duped? Well, you obviously can’t trust the negative Nancies dug into derisive ignorance as defense against FOMO. I mean, they proudly admit that they don’t know what they’re talking about. But you also can’t trust the exhausting monorail-salesman WAGMI hype.My general rule about subject in which I haven’t developed significant independent knowledge is simply to believe whatever the consensus of credible experts happens to be. That’s easier said than done in this case, because it’s tough to say what expertise or credibility looks like when there’s a hot dispute about the legitimacy of the entire domain. When the conditions for non-question-begging expert identification break down, there’s not a lot you can do other than to “do my own research,” fully aware of the pitfalls, and try to come to some reasonable conclusions on your own steam. It’s always disorienting to push into unfamiliar territory without a map, but that’s okay. Embracing the vertigo of not-knowing is how we learn. What I try to do in this sort of situation is steer into the confusion, horse around, experiment, and see if a gestalt of comprehension begins to coalesce. Because his monster thread below exploring all this stuff embodies the open-minded, spitballing, tinkering attitude this kind of task requires, I’ve adopted Venkatesh Rao as my spirit guide in this quest. This thread is really great and really long. You should browse through it. I promise you’ll learn something.   Anyway, what I did to get started was learn to use Metamask and buy some NFTs. Not some silly jpg cartoon avatar, mind you, but stuff that seemed to me more useful and functional. I bought an Ethereum Name Service domain, willwilkinson.eth. It makes it super-easy for people to send me money without knowing my public address. (You should try it!) It also makes it easy for anybody to see every transaction involving the connected wallet. So, for example, you can see that I bought some shitty Axies in Axie Infinity , which I used to get my ass kicked repeatedly by semi-pro Filipinos. You know what? It doesn’t feel like bullshit. This is when it really started to click to me. I’m not actually interested in fighting and breeding cute virtual creatures. But experiencing an in-game economy built to integrate with the real economy was eye-opening. Felix plays Roblox and loves to customize his avatar, collect pets, and special items his dude can carry around. He’d love to be able to literally own these things, buy and sell them, and cash out at the click of a button. But that kind of game application is just the most obvious type of thing blockchains makes easier. Presently, the dominant blockchain/Web 3.0 application is decentralized finance, but I think it’s easier to see the value of where things are heading, and to allay worries about hype cycles, pyramid schemes and speculative bubbles, if we look past the purely financial stuff.
