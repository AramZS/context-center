title: "As COVID precautions vanish, people with disabilities struggle with safety and isolation"
description: "The pace of COVID fatalities in the U.S. has slowed significantly, with the nationâ€™s death toll standing at more than 1 million people. With precautions like mandatory masking no longer in place, it can seem as if worries about the virus are gone as well. But for many people with disabilities, the threat is still very real. We hear from people in the disability community about their concerns."
