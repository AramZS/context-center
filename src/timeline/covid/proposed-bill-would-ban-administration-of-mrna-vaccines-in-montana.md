> According to Johns Hopkins, gene-based vaccines include those to protect against Covid-19, and vaccine manufacturers are developing mRNA vaccines to protect against other respiratory viruses.
> [...]
> Opponents, including the state medical officer, say the bill includes inaccurate information, and that the vaccines can’t shed to others because they don’t include live viruses. They also argue the vaccines have undergone rigorous research and are an emerging and important factor in battling infectious diseases, and the state already provides easily available vaccine exemptions, including for schoolchildren.

> “The statement that mRNA vaccines can integrate into the human genome and be passed onto the next generation is false. There’s no evidence for that. Second, mRNA vaccines do not shed. Shedding occurs with attenuated live virus vaccines,” said state medical officer Douglas Harrington. “The mRNA technology and gene-based technology, the way the bill is written, is adding a massive impact on our ability to treat diseases that we have not been able to treat or prevent before. These are things like tuberculosis, malaria, zika, the rapidly mutating influenza viruses.”
