title: "‘I Feel Like I Have Dementia’: Brain Fog Plagues Covid Survivors"
description: "Scientists aren’t sure what causes brain fog, which varies widely and affects even people who became only mildly physically ill from Covid-19 and had no previous medical conditions. Leading theories are that it arises when the body’s immune response to the virus doesn’t shut down or from inflammation in blood vessels leading to the brain."
