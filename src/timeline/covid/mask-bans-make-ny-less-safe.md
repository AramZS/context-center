> Earlier this month, the Nassau County legislature approved a bill banning people from wearing masks or face coverings in public. Violations could result in a $1,000 fine, up to a year in jail, or both. In May, a state legislator introduced a similar bill that would ban face coverings specifically at public gatherings, like protests. Governor Kathy Hochul has also expressed support for a mask ban on New York Cityâ€™s subway.
