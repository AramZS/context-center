> Later, during in-clinic assessments, the findings proved equally troubling. At 6-8 months old, 13 of 109 infants born to infected mothers — almost 12% — had failed to reach developmental milestones. In stark contrast, all infants in a control group born before the pandemic showed normal development.

> As additional participants from LA and Rio were enrolled, more unsettling results emerged. Around 11.6% of toddlers born to mothers with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy showed cognitive, motor, or language problems indicative of neurodevelopmental delays. By comparison, only two of 128 unexposed controls — 1.6% — showed such issues.

> When the eldest of the Covid-exposed babies reached 28 months, the study found another concerning pattern: 23 of 211 children — almost 11% — screened positive for autism spectrum disorder. The finding, presented in May at a medical conference in Copenhagen, compared with an expected prevalence of 1-2% at that age, when some children begin showing signs of the condition. Around one in 36 or under 3% of children are eventually diagnosed with autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The later findings, currently undergoing peer review ahead of publication, are a reminder that Covid’s long-term consequences, including higher risks for dementia and heart disease, continue to unravel almost five years after the pandemic began. While the virus is generally known to cause more severe symptoms in adults than in children, emerging research suggests that babies exposed to Covid in utero face elevated risks for preterm birth, congenital heart abnormalities and rare conditions, such as organs developing on the opposite side of the body.
