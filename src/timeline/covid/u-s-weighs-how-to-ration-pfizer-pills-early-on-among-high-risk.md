> Merck & Co.’s molnupiravir was authorized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration for use in adults at high risk of severe cases who have no other treatment option, though it is not recommended for pregnant women. Still, the U.S. will soon have three million courses available.

> Pfizer’s Paxlovid -- authorized earlier this week --showed stronger clinical trial data with President Joe Biden hailing the pill  as “a promising new treatment.” It will be available in limited quantities at first as Pfizer grinds through a months-long manufacturing process.
