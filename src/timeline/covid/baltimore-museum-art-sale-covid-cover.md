description: "The BMA recently announced that it would liquidate upward of $73 million in important paintings from its permanent collection. A brief window of opportunity had been thrown wide when one of the nationâ€™s two leading museum professional associations relaxed the rules, hoping to ease expected financial fallout from the COVID-19 tragedy. Baltimore soon ripped open an ethical breach big enough to drive a truck through."
