> The study’s authors emphasized that, as an observational study, the findings do not prove that covid-19 causes the conditions diagnosed in children, but rather signal an association between maternal infection and these outcomes. And the risk of such a diagnosis, even while elevated for women, remains extremely low, said Andrea G.
